The reality is quite the opposite. Most solo entrepreneurs spend most of their days behind the computer screen typing and browsing the web. All communication happens virtually and even phone calls are becoming something of the past. It can be difficult when you feel lonely as an entrepreneur.\n\n<b><a href="https://goo.gl/dLBkvs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLICK HERE TO WATCH</a></b>\n\nI know this problem too well. Being an entrepreneur myself, working from different locations and traveling across countries, I am most of the day working alone and virtually with teams and clients miles away from me. I have found that it can be unhealthy to continue working in my little bubble and the real need and desire to change that emerged only beginning of this year.\n\nWhile it may be comfortable to stay in my little zone, this doesn\'t come with any risks. Risks of being socially isolated, not able to communicate face to face with other human beings and risks of losing communication skills.\n\nIn this video, I explain how not to feel lonely as a solo entrepreneur, freelancer or self-employed. The saying \'It\'s lonely at the top\' can be very true but there is something to do about it because we have to remember that real interactions with people are what can bring and build meaningful and long-lasting relationships.\n\n<span style="color: red;"><b><a href="https://goo.gl/dLBkvs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch to find out what this ONE tip is.</a></b></span>\n\n<b>Please don\'t forget to like, subscribe to my channel and comment.

And since a lot of you voted for more travel videos on a recent Instagram poll, I thought why not vlog when I went to London last week.<br /><br />I have lived on 3 continents, 4 countries and 6 cities and London is the one that has a very special place in my heart. I love everything about the city: the people, food, vibe and this mixture of the British and European cultures.<br /><br />On this trip, I take you to the Big Ben, Trafalgar Square, the Thames, London Eye, Picadilly Circus etc on a week where it snowed so much that most schools were closed and the transportation was slow. Lucky me!!<br /><br />I hope you\'ll enjoy this video and if you do, please let me know!!<br /><br />Thanks for your support.&nbsp;</div>',

Showering, eating, working, commuting...some of us are chasing the end of the month salary. Some others the monthly pensions. But why do we live? What is the purpose of life? And do we have to have a purpose, to begin with?<br /><br />In my opinion, life without a purpose is a wasted life, especially that we currently live in a world that offers us so much more opportunities, better conditions of living and the internet. Yes, I had to say that because the internet brought more democracy into the world. Any average citizen\'s words have the same high chances of being heard as any country president or corporate CEO.&nbsp;<br /><br />Because so much is available to us already, we should make it a goal to have a higher purpose in life. Our primary goals (paying the bills and having food on the table) shouldn\'t be our ultimate goals. Our existence should have a bigger meaning that goes beyond just our little comfort and interests.<br /><br />Making an impact, leaving a legacy and mattering in life will bring us a satisfaction not only on earth but also in the hereafter (I think). Knowing that we have served, helped, been there for someone or many people can only be a satisfying feeling of an accomplished mission.<br /><br />Wherever you are. Whatever you do. STOP and rethink what you do on a daily basis. What is the legacy you want to leave in this world?<br /><br /><span style="color: red;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnseynjSRLw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><b>WATCH THE VIDEO AND LEAVE A COMMENT ON WHAT YOU THINK YOUR LIFE PURPOSE IS.</b></a></span><br /><br /></div>',

Powerful brands in the digital world are extremely good at communicating with their audiences. They know who they audiences are and what they want to read or see. For that, it is important to know what your purpose is and what you\'d like to achieve by posting and being active online.<br /><br />In this interview, Serge Samoilenko, a communication instructor at George Mason University in Virginia, USA, talks about how to build a strong personal brand online and why some brands are not \'communicators\'. He also explains what digital risks are and how to avoid them when building your brand online.<br /><br />Serge also reveals who you should go to first when promoting your products/services and the secret to really standing out and building a strong following.<br /><br /><b><a href="https://goo.gl/scxVmg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch the video and please comment and share!!</a></b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>',

If you want to succeed in life, you will have to network,. It doesn\'t matter if you’re an introvert or extrovert. Networking and meeting new people will help you grow, open up your mind and will trigger life-changing opportunities.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Now that you know you cannot go it alone and that most successful people if not all of them have big networks that help them achieve their goals, let’s get to actually what you could do to start making meaningful connections:</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>1. Be nice to everybody.</b> You don’t need a reason to be nice to people. In fact, generally, when I get asked about job interviews etc, I usually recommend to be nice to everyone you come across to from, the building entrance to the actual job interview office. You might never know who the person you’re coming across in the elevator is: it could be your future boss or the cleaner who will one day help you lock you out of the office bathroom. The idea is to be nice to everyone without necessarily expecting anything back.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>2. Listen and then talk. </b>The foundation of communication lies in listening. Before you start talking about yourself, your goals, business, life etc, listen to what others need, want, look for. First of all, you learn so much by listening and also, you understand better the market needs and how you can contribute and help.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>3. Know what you’re looking for and how you can help. </b>People network to get business contracts, more clients, and more sales. It’s important to know what it is you’re after while networking. Be specific about your need because if it’s not clear to you, it won’t be clear to others. And also, make sure you have something you can offer. Remember networking is a two-way street.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>4.&nbsp; Follow up and deliver your promises.</b> If you promised someone you’d send them a presentation when you get back to the office or you’d call them on a given day, then you most certainly should do so. Building a strong network is about respecting other people and nurturing the relationship you wish to have with them.</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><b>5. Schedule networking on your planner. </b>Whether offline or online, networking should be an essential part of your business activity. Networking can be with your future employer, client, contractor, employee or co-workers. People buy from people. And whatever service or product you’re offering, people will look at who’s behind it before they decide to purchase it. Make sure networking is part of your daily activity. And thanks God for Linked, Facebook, Twitter etc!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>To help you take networking to the next level, I have prepared a workbook for you which will help you get clear on your networking goals and make a plan to effectively start making meaningful connections. Just enter your email address on my blog: <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/">www.safaanhairy.com</a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Also, let me down below who did you meet who’s helped you tremendously in your professional and business life?</div>\n<div></div>\n<div>Let’s stay in touch on social media!</div>\n<div></div>\n<div><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wor0ha1ySoY&amp;t=29s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span style="color: red;"><b>WATCH THE VIDEO ON WHY YOU SHOULD START NETWORKING NO</b></span><b><span style="color: red;">W</span></b></a></div>\n<div></div>\n<div></div>\n</div>',

The young also bring an ability to leverage technology – in the form of ecommerce and web-based business tools – to build Moroccan-based businesses that serve a world-wide market.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Safaa Nhairy is a well-known Moroccan entrepreneur and is the subject of this paper.&nbsp; Ms. Nhairy is of particular interest for several reasons.&nbsp; First, she herself is a confluence of many relevant themes. She was raised in Morocco but has an international educational background (having attended college in Washington, D.C. and London, and teaching as a professor in Morocco); she is trilingual, and her various professional endeavors are simultaneously highly localized and expansively international. Next, she is a native change agent for entrepreneurs.&nbsp; Her work includes articles, blogs and videos to teach and encourage business-builders and risk-takers. As a young, ambitious, highly articulate woman she serves as a vital role model for her nation’s emerging economy and youthful business leaders, while remaining respectful of traditional values. Finally, her philosophy reflects many leadership ideals that are relevant to every successful business regardless of size or location.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">This paper fulfills the assignment to investigate change agents in the emerging Morocco market in two ways.&nbsp; Safaa founded and grew several businesses that mix traditional services (like media consulting) with contemporary technology (web-based commerce and communication) to serve targeted Moroccan consumers and businesses. &nbsp;Her business journey is pioneering as she is a young, female, entrepreneur succeeding in a traditional, male- and elder- dominated, relationship-intensive business climate.&nbsp; Marketing is the primary business function where she demonstrated innovation, including:<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="background: white; margin-bottom: 13.5pt; margin-left: .5in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; mso-list: l0 level1 lfo1; text-indent: -.25in;"><!--[if !supportLists]--><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="color: #252525; font-size: 11pt;">-<span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; line-height: normal;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><!--[endif]--><span dir="LTR"></span><span style="font-size: 11pt;">How to market successfully as a business serving Morocco.

Safaa is a living example of appreciative inquiry: she actively invests in inspiring and educating others on how to be a successful entrepreneur, but also to aspire towards their greatest potential in all life endeavors. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div><br /></div><div><b><span style="font-size: 12pt; line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Part 1: Research Narrative<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></div><div><b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Research Commentary<o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The majority of content about Ms. Nhairy is derived from her blog, videos, interviews and the articles she has composed for various publications. This narrative presents her viewpoint on the assigned topics based on these sources, which offered ample insight into her entrepreneurial and change-embracing philosophy. Ms. Nhairy also generously responded to a request for an email interview.&nbsp; Where appropriate, her responses from this interview are directly quoted.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Morocco’s Economic &amp; Political Environment<o:p></o:p></span></b></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Ranked as the fourth most competitive country in Africa by the World Economic Forum’s 2014-2015 Global Competitiveness Report, Morocco’s economy is undergoing an exciting transition. The dominance of the traditional agricultural sector has declined, manufacturing is stagnant and the services sector has increased in recent years. These shifts reflect modernization and positive global influences but have not been enough to support full employment, especially for young citizens.&nbsp; As a result, entrepreneurial activity has gained momentum, breaking through many cultural and governmental barriers.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-left: 22.5pt;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="background: white; color: #252525; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 107%;">&nbsp;“The global economy pushed Moroccans to<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span style="background: white; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 107%;">reconsider their lifestyle and life goals<span style="color: #252525;">, and find new ways of taking control of their lives, especially in that the bureaucratic mindset of most Moroccan companies is off-putting,’ says Kenza Bennis, a 30-year-old entrepreneur (Changing Face, 2016.)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The exhaustive Global Competitiveness Report (Global Competitiveness, 2015) describes 12 Pillars of competitiveness for 144 countries.&nbsp; Morocco lands at the mid-point ‘Efficiency Driven’ stage of development.&nbsp; The most problematic factors for doing business in Morocco are identified as:&nbsp; access to financing, inefficient government bureaucracy, inadequately educated workforce and inadequate supply of infrastructure, corruption and tax rates. These all put strong pressure against the emerging entrepreneurial sector.<span><span style="background: white; color: #252525;"><o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div><span><span style="background: white; color: #252525;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">While the government is highly bureaucratic and resistant to change, it has recognized the start-up mentality as an important driver for new jobs.&nbsp; As a result, recent changes have been initiated for easier and faster business procedures for hiring, taxes, and administrative filings that are aimed to help young entrepreneurs. <o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div><span><span style="background: white; color: #252525;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The business and community culture in Morocco tends to be resistant to this emerging business philosophy. The parental population presses hard on the traditional path of higher education followed by a corporate job, even as their young adult children face a very limited job market.&nbsp; The long-ingrained Arabic business culture operates with deep networks and very formal business interactions which are not consistent with the youthful entrepreneurial spirit.&nbsp; Gaining funding is very difficult as it is illegal (per Arabic law) to charge interest, making loans and access to capital a demanding and complicated process. Increasingly, investment capital is sourced from foreign investors. Access to training and mentoring present further hurdles to aspiring businesses because risk-taking and innovation are not part of Morocco’s heritage.&nbsp; As Ms. Nhairy states:<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div style="margin-left: .25in;"><span><span style="background: white; color: #252525; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">“In Morocco, the cultural environment doesn’t encourage people to fail.

These include a program to fosters the entrepreneurial ecosystem call called Office Chérifien des Phosphates (OCP) (the largest global producer of phosphate rock and controlled by the Moroccan state); and organizations like INJAZ Al Maghreb, ENACTUS, Start Up Your Life and MCISE that offer guidance to new business owners. Research into these organizations yielded excellent information about many Moroccan entrepreneurs and their journey to overcome obstacles and build successful businesses.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div><span><b><span style="background: white; color: #252525;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Factors contributing to the business and entrepreneurial influences <o:p></o:p></span></span></b></span></div><div><span><span style="background: white; color: #252525;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The founding of her media company, iMediaRt, followed naturally from Safaa’s formal education and her professional experience in media and communications. &nbsp;Her general business and functional experience was also a key factor in the decision to start a communications company.&nbsp; Because she engaged in professional media work at age 13 and had published a magazine at age 17, she had significant business depth in spite of her youth.&nbsp; I believe that her exposure to foreign countries and diverse business climates during her educational years contributed to her highly evolved global perspective.&nbsp; This allowed her to think beyond the limits of Moroccan business culture to creatively establish a profitable company in a highly competitive segment. <o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><span><span style="background: white; color: #252525;">Safaa presents herself and is recognized for her independence of action and thought.&nbsp; This description in an interview conducted </span></span><span><span style="background: white;">by Wafin (</span></span>a portal dedicated to Moroccan American business and cultural interests<span><span style="background: white;">) accurately captures this trait w<span style="color: #252525;">hen describing her:&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></span></span></div><div style="margin-left: .25in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><span><span style="background: white; color: #252525; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 107%;">“Her readership admires her for her “audacity;” she tackles topics that most people prefer to ignore.</span></span><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; line-height: 107%; mso-bidi-font-size: 11.0pt;"> </span><span><span style="background: white; color: #252525; font-size: 10pt; line-height: 107%;">Her last column on her website was about the importance of one to think for him/herself, and not let any outside power influence one’s thinking.

This complete accountability to oneself is mandatory for any entrepreneur when facing countless challenges and opinions in the midst of a breakthrough change.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div><span><span style="background: white; color: #252525;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Risk taking is not a behavior typically associated with Morocco in any environment and in fact, is shunned as undesirable in social and business interactions.&nbsp; It was not an easy or obvious decision to establish a media company in Casablanca when Ms. Nhairy founded iMediaRt.&nbsp; She carefully qualified the benefits of leveraging her passion and skills against the risk of being a bold new player with something unique to sell.&nbsp; She made her bet, and won in the face of difficult odds.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div><span><span style="background: white; color: #252525;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">A last facet of her character that has had a strong influence on her journey is her commitment to giving back to her community.&nbsp; As she explains it:&nbsp; “I learned being an entrepreneur in Morocco in the hard way.&nbsp; I used to teach at university …. and missed it a lot, so I decided to post on YouTube to share my experience, give tips and advice to aspiring entrepreneurs … my purpose is to share my learnings and benefit as many people as possible.” This drive to openly engage infuses her creative and leadership style and ultimately, is a dominant aspect in her ability to influence change.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Part II:&nbsp; Safaa’s Story<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Setting the Stage<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Safaa’s ambition manifested itself at a very early age.&nbsp; She hosted a television show at age 13 and achieved her personal goal to publish a magazine at age 17. She sharpened her sense of Moroccan heritage and her global perspective during her collegiate studies in the United States and England.&nbsp; She went on to found several companies, overcoming the inherent risk-averse, change-resistant business culture of her home country.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Her writings span her educational, professional and personal journeys and reveal an ongoing personal challenge:&nbsp; how to bring her energy, experience and mentoring skills together for the benefit of aspiring business people.&nbsp; What is unique in her story is not the problems or conflicts in building her business (which were many,) but rather her impressive determination to take risks and inspire those around her. These are the defining characteristics of an entrepreneurial change agent. Ms. Nhairy’s motto, as posted on her blog (Nhairy Blog, n.d.) captures the challenge she lives by and promotes to those who follow her:&nbsp; “whatever you do, do it passionately.”&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><b><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Our Hero<o:p></o:p></span></span></b></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">At a Tedx Talk event in November, 2016 sponsored by Mines Rabat (the National School of Mineral Industry, based in Rabat, Morocco), Safaa presented a life-changing chapter in her story.&nbsp; The summary of this talk was: “<span style="background: white;">Your brain will always be against you, so accept your fears and embrace your struggles then take action because it speaks louder than words (TedX Challenge, 2016.)<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><span style="background: white;">Her presentation opens with a description of herself as</span> a lonely and exhausted student in the United States. She is overwhelmed, in part, by a constant demand to defend her culture and religion in a foreign country.&nbsp; In spite of her many accomplishments, intelligence and drive, she is questioning her destiny. In describing this personal milestone, Safaa demonstrates a core conviction that is at the essence of her entrepreneurial spirit: your destiny is within your control.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The Tedx Talk unfolds to describe her determination to “do something’ by facing the fear and the pain in her brain.”&nbsp; Her message is to accept that pain is part of life because it is not productive to concede to it, nor to yield control of your destiny because the journey is hard or painful.&nbsp; A person’s ability to embrace and overcome pain is vital in every step of their business and life journey in her belief.&nbsp; She directly challenges her Tedx Talk audience with: “if you are seeking comfort, you will never experience magic.”<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Pain in Safaa’s definition has much to do with a compulsion to act and bring value in life. It was this sensation that ultimately drives her to found her original business called iMediaRt. &nbsp;As she describes it, upon her return from school, she worked at several institutions in Morocco only to discover that the work climate was not a fit for her goals and business philosophy. She founded iMediaRt to ensure that her vision for customers and employees would thrive in spite of being contrary to the business norms.&nbsp; In driving iMediaRt to success, she decided to translate her experience as an entrepreneur (combined with her teaching skills) to become a mentor and spokesperson for emerging Moroccan entrepreneurs. &nbsp;The following is an accurate description of growing Ms. Nhairy’s influence around the globe:&nbsp; “Fresh, young and novel, Safaa Nhairy represents the new generation of Moroccans seeking positive change and intellectual development” (Moroccan of the Month, 2004.)<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b><span style="line-height: 107%;">Trials and tribulations</span></b><span style="line-height: 107%;"> <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">“When I set up [iMediaRt] I realized that there were so many media agencies in Morocco …. that I had to work really hard to find a niche and make a name” (Nhairy, 2017.)&nbsp; Building a company based upon her passion for communications, Safaa talks about several pressure points, her creative solutions and reactions from the business community.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Her first priority was to build something that was a true money-making business.&nbsp; This economic goal sounds obvious, but as a young woman in the Moroccan environment, her professional mind-set and approach was unusual.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the media communications segment, there were many operators who lacked true credentials and skills but who were able to leverage their established networks to win customers.&nbsp; Lacking easy access to customers via an extensive network, Safaa identified her second challenge:&nbsp; what new, different capability could she provide to capture the attention of the market?<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">“The quality of work was only a detail in running their business,” says Safaa when describing the typical attitude of her competition. This lack of consideration for quality and timeliness gave rise to the iMediaRt identity: Safaa created unique relationships with both her clients and her employees where respect was foundational and commitments were honored.&nbsp; It was particularly challenging, in Safaa’s words, “to make a name in an environment that doesn’t believe much in hard work and integrity.&nbsp; Business making in Morocco tends to rhyme with bribery, gifts and other monetary advantages in exchange for [winning] a project or PO” (Nhairy, 2017.)&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Her strategy was two-fold.&nbsp; First, she decided to be very selective with her customers.&nbsp; She only worked with firms who embraced the same values and who could be counted on to make payments.&nbsp; By emphasizing shared values, she could win projects over her competition because her target customers cared about quality service delivered on time, as promised.&nbsp; Even so, she describes the effort required to achieve economic success:&nbsp; “You have to sweat day in and out, make daily phone calls, and send regular reminders to get your payment” (Nhairy, 2017.)&nbsp; This investment in hard work and diligence is typical of any early stage company.&nbsp; When the entrepreneurial founder makes this investment in ‘sweat equity’, it conveys to customers and employees – through action, not words – exactly what is important to the firm. <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The second part of her strategy was a unique approach to employee engagement and expectations.&nbsp; Team work and accountability are not native to the business culture in Morocco.&nbsp; Also, the communication style does not promote open engagement.&nbsp; People do not ask for help, nor do they actively problem-solve with peers.&nbsp; Her comment:&nbsp; “when you distribute a task and think that it’s a work in progress when in fact it’s not, can be really tough and frustrating to deal with” (Nhairy, 2017.) &nbsp;&nbsp;She learned to be very active in her firm’s delivery process to reinforce objectives and timelines with her team, and to support delivering on time and as promised to customers.&nbsp; Further, she was very progressive with the concept of empowerment.&nbsp; In Morocco, the culture tends to be very directive:&nbsp; elder or senior roles provide specific direction to employees.&nbsp; Workers are educated that they will be ‘told’ what to do and it is not expected (or even tolerated) that they would contribute ideas or input into a process.&nbsp; Of course, this type of thinking leads to the absence of accountability and integrity.&nbsp; Safaa took the unusual approach of actively pushing for “employees to take a leadership role no matter what their job position was” (Nhairy, 2017.) &nbsp;&nbsp;It took constant attention to overcome the tendency to ignore delays or problems and build an open work culture. Again, her words reflect her natural leadership instincts:&nbsp; ‘I learned to keep checking back throughout the process.&nbsp; It’s certainly time-consuming and annoying but in this situation, my comfort is not the priority!” (Nhairy, 2017.)<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">The impact of her leadership in executing her business strategy (one that is quite radical by Moroccan standards) is summarized in this observation:&nbsp; “Our goals were to offer outstanding service…. Our clients used to thank us several times because they couldn’t believe that we delivered on the date we committed to” (Nhairy, 2017.)<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Ms. Nhairy has gone beyond iMediaRt to found several other companies based upon her innate ability to see opportunity, design creative solutions and launch new projects.<o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b><span style="line-height: 107%;">A turning point and resolution</span></b><span style="line-height: 107%;"> <o:p></o:p></span></span></div><div><br /></div><div><span><span style="background: white; line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Safaa is living example of transformative energy.&nbsp; In her professional journey she has been guided by clear values and an unusually high sense of community obligation.&nbsp; This combination enables her to tackle problems, garner support and drive success in a way that truly transforms the people and processes around her.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div><span><span style="background: white; line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">She describes her values as being universal in spite of the many diverse influences in her life. Her Islamic background “lays the foundation for my acts and behaviors.”&nbsp; Yet she brings a distinctly western approach to her businesses, leveraging ideas of accountability and open communication. She firmly believes that there should not be a choice between following good values and doing business, but admits that it is hard to live up to this standard.&nbsp; She says “it requires more work, strength and patience” to act upon her values and this is evident in her many blog postings where she is very candid in discussing challenges and failures.&nbsp; <o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div><span><span style="background: white; line-height: 107%;"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Her insight into failure is an important learning. Entrepreneurial endeavors fail far more often than they succeed.&nbsp; This is a commonly quoted statistic but failing still comes as a shock and disappointment to most business people.&nbsp; What is fascinating about Safaa’s story is not that she embraces failure as a true learning opportunity, but that she will take the risk in the first place.&nbsp; The national culture in Morocco is decidedly risk averse.&nbsp; Failing comes with losing face, confidence and social or ethical position.&nbsp; In contrast to Western cultures, it is common to ‘agree’ to a false deadline and repeatedly delay rather than admit that there was a failure to meet a commitment.&nbsp; Taking the risk to create a business is demanding enough, but Safaa chose the far riskier path of committing to accountability in an environment that is contra-accountable in most cases.&nbsp; Transformation of culture and behavior require conviction and tireless energy, both of which are natural to Safaa.<o:p></o:p></span></span></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><span><span style="background: white; line-height: 107%;">Finally, her sense of community drives her to engage, share and inspire those would also contribute to transformations.&nbsp; It is not enough to want success for yourself, but also to engage others and even more importantly:&nbsp; to demonstrate the possibility of change.&nbsp; By showing clients that timely, quality results can be achieved, her clients shifted their expectations of other suppliers to do the same as iMediaRt.&nbsp; This is exactly the incremental shift that can influence change at scale in a highly dynamic economy and culture like Morocco.&nbsp; Safaa sums it up best “Change starts with and within ourselves first and to influence a country, many people should share the same vision and have a set of common values.”</span></span><span><span style="background: white;

    Title: "What building a REAL business means",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Many people dream of launching their own businesses. And when they do, they end up creating jobs for themselves. They certainly are their own bosses but when they\'re off sick or on holiday, their business activity is on leave as well.\n\n<iframe width="320" height="266" style="clear: right; float: right;" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DAXgWOb3zz0/0.jpg" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DAXgWOb3zz0?feature=player_embedded"></iframe>When I read <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/2016/12/26/my-top-business-and-personal-development-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">\'Poor Dad. Rich Dad\'</a> by Robert Kiyosake more than 10 years ago, the cashflow quadrant, he talks about, was to me, such a revelation. I understood that building a real business is much more than just being your own boss and enjoying the freedom that comes with it. Building a business is a commercial activity that requires a system. And this is the key thing lacking so many so-called businesses. To be clear, a system is a process where none of the steps rely on you completely. In other words, you need to set the outcomes and objectives clear, draft manuals/ training workbooks, train and hire people and track the system efficiency.  In today\'s world, this is even easier to achieve thanks to e-commerce and the internet. Automatisation is key to growing a business.\n\nOne thing to remember is that you only have so many hours a day and can\'t possibly grow your business fast alone. Now my nextdoor accountant, whom I thought had a business, is actually stuck. After 15 years of being an independent accountant, he still needs to show up every day to the office and do the work by himself. If he doesn\'t, everything gets delayed and unhappy customers are not returning. The same goes for the tailor, graphic design, web developer etc. There are just so many outputs they can deliver a day.\n\nIf you\'re seriously thinking about starting and building a high-growth business, I\'d highly recommend you create and design a business with a system where you\'d be out of the picture. Focus on your clients and how you are going to deliver them your products/services whether you\'re climbing Mount Everest or just spending your afternoon chilling at the pool.\n\nRemember self employed people ARE the business, whereas entrepreneurs OWN the business.\n\n<b>QUESTION: What business idea do you have and how are you going to systematize it?</b>\n\n</div>',

The goals can sometimes feel overwhelming&nbsp;or unattainable if some steps are not taken underway.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">I find that to have what it takes to achieve big goals is to:</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="color: red; font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><a href="https://youtu.be/LIxkIFfwqAw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO</a></span></b><br /><br /><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>Invest in yourself:</b> Learn, learn, learn! Learning is not limited to college degrees. Learning should be a daily need and task to keep up with the new trends of your market and expanding your mind. Don\'t be greedy when it comes to investing in yourself monetarily; buy and read books, go to workshops and seminars, get online education etc. This is a much worthy investment and you will never regret spending money on learning.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>Expand your horizons: </b>In other words, go outside of your comfort zone. Being confined in an environment, being around the same people and going to the same places all the way will only limit your ability to think outside of the box and prevent from thinking outside of the box. Travel, meet new people, try new restaurants, move cities or countries...do uncomfortable things that will challenge you and help you know yourself better.You will grow and be more open to the world. You will also understand better why successful people become successful.</span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>Take care of yourself:</b> Your body and mind are your greatest resources. You have to take care of them because they fail you. Nurture them. Give them the love they deserve. Cherish your physical, mental and emotional health. If you take care of your health, it\'ll always be there for you when needed. Whether it\'s working out, eating&nbsp;healthy&nbsp;food, quitting smoking, drinking more water, meditating (or getting a massage), make your health a priority in your daily planner.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Whatever your plans and goals are this year, if you don\'t work on them daily and schedule them on your calendar, chances are they will stay just goals on paper. Commit to making them happen. Learn, expand your mind and take care of yourself!</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Wishing you an amazing 2018.

    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div><br /></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7zVSDSOhgNI/Wki81L-y3wI/AAAAAAAAWcY/lk1ne5gAeToQ-kDJ_wT3MpKcDFs_4yLeACLcBGAs/s1600/Safaa1.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1080" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7zVSDSOhgNI/Wki81L-y3wI/AAAAAAAAWcY/lk1ne5gAeToQ-kDJ_wT3MpKcDFs_4yLeACLcBGAs/s320/Safaa1.png" width="320" /></a></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">What a year!! Challenging, to say the least, both personally and professionally. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I certainly was exposed to problems I never have dealt before. Often times, I felt clueless and disoriented. Usually, when we face tough situations, we ask people around us for some guidance. But in my case, my problems were also new to people around me which made it even harder to figure out. Personal research (Thanks Google and YouTube) was my best bet. It often felt tedious and dreary and most of the time not enough. I realized that a change of environment is important. For one’s growth and sanity, you have to be with people higher than you or at least at the same level as you in life. Learning from others is so invaluable and it can be a huge lifesaver. Upgrading your network will make life so much easier on you and also fun. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I am usually good at goal-setting and completing tasks. But this year, I felt like I didn’t push myself to create bigger and more challenging goals. I played it safe and I felt it. I didn’t even do my yearly routine appropriately. Around the end of year&nbsp;of2016, I was dealing with some health issues and sleep deprivation. My mental and physical health were not at their best. So, I started the year slow. No big goals or resolutions. Just some wishes that didn’t put into paper. This clearly confirmed the theory of when you think small, you play small too. No magic takes place when you stay in the comfort zone.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This year, I also realized that some of the strategies I use daily to keep focused, productive, and motivated were not enough for my growth. I felt I needed something else to keep me going and to help me achieve bigger goals. Hitting a plateau was to me a waste of time and I needed to figure things out pretty quickly. I still do not have the full answer but it’s in the process. Unsurprisingly, to perform at a higher level, some new skills and habits have to be put in place and they definitely do not come naturally. I see it exactly as an athlete. An athlete is not born with all the qualities and skills he needs to succeed and win at every competition. He continuously needs new challenges, skills, training, habits, coaching, and techniques. And this is all very unnatural. So, to tap into new greater things, enough with the inner strengths and gifts speeches...<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Around, the third quarter of the year, I had a considerable issue with an important client. I always take every project with any client very seriously, whether it be a small or big one. This time, it was a big project and something went wrong. I cannot blame them for their dissatisfaction of my work because I take some responsibility over it. The project happened at a time where I was going through a big move and had to not only deal with the boxes and the packing but only with the emotional stuff going with it. Perhaps I relied too much on my team which resulted in an unhappy client. I learned to keep focused, acknowledge my part of responsibility in the mess and be prepared to lose the client. I was mentally prepared to lose the client because somehow, I knew I deserved it. Till today, I am still unsure whether this client is coming back or not.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This year also challenged me to be strong for others. While I can mentally talk to myself to keep on going, other human beings relying on me, especially little ones, needed a huge emotional support and reassurance. I consciously deployed myself into nurturing, loving, reassuring, helping one and the other adjusting through the phases we were going through. I knew every word, every action would have a consequence and I needed to say and do just the right things. I learned that being present and doing your duties are not enough. People need to hear you say things they want to hear. You have to say those things to make your life and their lives better.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">This year taught me a number of lessons. I cannot say that it is getting easier because every new step in life unfolds new challenges and difficulties. Pain is always around the corner. I almost never feel I have everything figured out. And with this fast-paced world, you always need to see things with fresh eyes. You can never take anything for granted or believe you have THE answer for everything.

      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/AHQsE40YQCA/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHQsE40YQCA?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Sometimes, life can be really tough. We&nbsp; feel demotivated, stressed and not feeling to do anything.&nbsp;It’s a natural feeling to feel demotivated especially during difficult times. Sustaining motivation can be tough even under the best circumstances. But, because you may have so many responsibilities, you may not have the&nbsp;option to stay in bed all day watching Netflix, while it passes. You need to keep on showing up and being the best you can be. So, in today’s video, I am giving you three tips on how to stay motivated even during difficult times.</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>CLICK ON THE PHOTO TO WATCH THE VIDEO</b></span></div><div style="text-align: left; text-indent: -0.25in;"></div><ul style="text-align: left;"><li><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; <b>&nbsp; &nbsp;Always have a vision board, a goals-list, and</b><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;"><b> a notebook.</b> I find these 3 things extremely helpful when I am unwell and not feeling like doing anything. They actually help me re-center myself and see the bigger picture. A</span><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;">lways go back to your vision board, list of goals and refresh your mind as to why you’re here: your purpose and mission in life.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b><span style="font-size: 7pt; font-stretch: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; font-variant-numeric: normal; line-height: normal; text-indent: -0.25in;">&nbsp;</span><span dir="LTR" style="text-indent: -0.25in;"></span></b><span style="text-indent: -0.25in;"><b>Stop comparing yourself to others. </b>This is the worst thing you can do to yourself. It will only bring you negativity and bad energy. Instead, focus on you and your loved ones. Remember that you are loved and needed by the most important people in your life. They love you just like you are. And spending hours scrolling photos on Instagram will not help you get closer to your dreams.</span></span></li><li><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <b>Do something different.</b> Whether it’s going to new places. Meeting new people or treating yourself to some new experience. You will find that by doing that you will see that there’s still so much to be discovered and explored. Your demotivation can actually be a hindrance to your growth. Changing environments and routines will bring some freshness to your life and shake you somehow.</span></li></ul><!--[if !supportLists]--><br /><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Remember it’s okay to be demotivated sometimes but every hour you spend losing motivation is a lost hour where you could have done more work, smiled more, served more people and gotten closer to achieving your goals and enjoying life more. These are hours you will never get back. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Let me down below how you motivate yourself when you’re not feeling like doing anything.&nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span></div><div><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>CLICK ON THE PHOTO TO WATCH THE VIDEO</b></span></div><div><br /></div><br /><div><br /></div></div>',

If you\'re looking for high business education to become an entrepreneur, then there are skills you need to acquire for you to succeed at your self-education. Entrepreneurship is more about the experience than theory. Remember our ancestors. As merchants, they had nothing but experience to learn from.<br /><br />If you want to start a business and educate yourself before you do, then in this video, I tell you what, I find, are the most important skills to focus on. Now, remember, you need to be very determined to learn on your own, dedicate time and make it a commitment for you to fast-track your succeed and avoid the long hours in classrooms.<br /><br />Happy watching and happy learning!<br /><br /><b>QUESTION: Do you think self-education can replace classic and academic education?</b></div>',

      "December Challenge: It's NOT too Late to Make this Year a Remarkable Year",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Lspkrlo-NSU/WiEd_otO1_I/AAAAAAAAWZ4/anBE6QzhcdY5lpDEs5RnfPmZlBbl21-vwCLcBGAs/s1600/December%2BGoals.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="560" data-original-width="560" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Lspkrlo-NSU/WiEd_otO1_I/AAAAAAAAWZ4/anBE6QzhcdY5lpDEs5RnfPmZlBbl21-vwCLcBGAs/s320/December%2BGoals.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>HO! HO! HO! It\'s that time of the year... Not to celebrate and exchange gifts (at least not for me). On December 1st, it\'s hustle time. It\'s that time I push myself to get back on track and catch up on all pending to-dos, goals, and dreams. In other words, I use December&nbsp;as a month of challenge to complete the objectives I had for that year or at least get significant progress on that.<br /><br />There can be so many distractions in life and the social media and the internet can eat up most of our time (it used to be TV). Now, to achieve goals, I first need to get organized:<br /><br />1. Review my goals for the past year<br />2. Check the completed goals<br />3. Zoom on the remaining ones<br /><br />When I have my remaining goals set clear on paper, I can then evaluate what can quickly be done immediately (if your goal is to get fit, you can already start doing today) and what would take longer to achieve.<br /><br />For the immediate actions, there is no secret to this. I just make time for them on my calendar. Using the example above, I would&nbsp;schedule working-out on M-W-F from 7-8pm for the entire month of December. This will actually help me create a habit and by the end of the year, it\'ll be part of my routine.<br /><br />The same goes for learning a new skill (language, cooking, music, etc). I\'d schedule it on my planner as if it were an appointment I had to go to.<br /><br />To succeed at my commitments, I\'d need to limit distractions: set my phone on airplane mode or grayscale it, isolate myself in a quiet room in the house... In sum, I need to create the conditions for me to help myself achieve that goal.<br /><br />Longer goals, however, must be chunked into small steps. If, for example, I have as a goal buying a house, the steps I can take on this December&nbsp;(to get closer to my goal) would be:<br />1. Browse real estate websites and checking with property counselors<br />2. Visit some properties<br />3. Have a meeting with my bank manager to discuss the financing/ Plan the house financing<br />4. Start getting the money and documents ready<br />5. Purchase the house<br /><br />Now it is possible I do not get to point 5 and that\'s fine. I would have gone through the 4 steps and would be prepared in case a great opportunity comes up.<br /><br />The idea is pretty simple, each day I need to get some progress on the \'remaining goals\' to be achieved.<br /><br />Some people, yesterday on the FB Live, mentioned&nbsp;the difficulty of working for others and at the same time making time to achieve their personal goals. I can understand that but you can still use your lunchtime break and after work hours to move ahead. One to 2 hours a day is great for you to see some progress. And make use of the weekends as well. Social gatherings can be good but when there are too many of them, they can suck up your energy and be a time-waster. Use your time wisely.<br /><br />So, let\'s get the ball rolling! Don\'t delay. Start today and will touchbase&nbsp;again soon to see how you\'re doing.<br /><br />Make this year a remarkable and unforgettable year.<br /><br />Let the challenge begin! GO!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>',

    Title: "My values: A Blessing and a Curse",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">My values are both a blessing and a curse. A blessing because they are the foundation of who I am, the decisions I make and the actions I undertake. A curse because they limit me somehow.<br /><br />Being an entrepreneur gives you choice to lead your business as you wish. It also gives you the possibility to explore new fields, let your dreams grow and enable your ambitions to become reality. However, often, business development and integrity clash.&nbsp; This clash is even more important in some countries where bribes and corruption are the common procedure. In other words, the size of your business demonstrates how much you have corrupted.<br /><br /><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--7nexVrViqw/WfscMoXah9I/AAAAAAAAWVo/2J2RV-ML-BgmW-Zmf4DeGBhGBFcrgUo6wCLcBGAs/s1600/bri.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="539" data-original-width="768" height="224" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/--7nexVrViqw/WfscMoXah9I/AAAAAAAAWVo/2J2RV-ML-BgmW-Zmf4DeGBhGBFcrgUo6wCLcBGAs/s320/bri.jpg" width="320" /></a>Clearly, everything is possible when you are an entrepreneur. When facing an obstacle, you know that sometimes the easy solution is a big fat envelope (or briefcase) full of cash to solve the issue. Same goes with clients. You want to keep them and feel that they are happy to give you business only when you make the gesture. Your hands are tied. You know the potential of your business lies in your hands: how much you can give out for presents and gifts.<br /><br />This is where the entrepreneur\'s values come in and establish the company\'s values. Having a business and life philosophy&nbsp;help shape the business in a way that it reflects your personality. It\'s a projection of who you are. Your business and you shouldn\'t&nbsp;clash. You, the entrepreneur, feed your business with your values and guide it as you would do for a baby of yours.<br /><br />I know I have lost many business opportunities. I know I could have done better. I know I could have made much more money. But at the end of the day, I feel and am myself. I can go to bed with peace of mind.<br /><br />May you have a successful business without compromising&nbsp;your values. Amen!<br /><b><br /></b><b>QUESTION :&nbsp;Are you for or against using personal compensation/gains in exchange for a business deal?</b></div>',

    Title: "What excuses do you have (again)?",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">This past year has been one of the most difficult years I have ever had. It was a year full of challenges, obstacles, difficulties, uncertainties, and struggles. It was a year where I was stretched, had my limits tested and a lot of times, I wanted to drop everything to keep my sanity...<br /><br />Each time I was feeling low and on the verge of quitting, I had a thought for those less privileged. I guess I was my own mentor/coach. But with time, I sincerely realized that my problems or at least what I perceived as problems were the results of a life full of things taken for granted and depreciated. In other words, my \'problems\' could in fact be a joy, delight, treasure, to someone else. In fact, there is a saying that goes: One man\'s trash is another man\'s treasure<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9YU-ZMRxtb4/WdC_aUlsbHI/AAAAAAAAWSQ/386rVFwsgekHtGTbcZlQLa8NQSotz0YuwCEwYBhgL/s1600/cried.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="315" data-original-width="461" height="217" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9YU-ZMRxtb4/WdC_aUlsbHI/AAAAAAAAWSQ/386rVFwsgekHtGTbcZlQLa8NQSotz0YuwCEwYBhgL/s320/cried.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br />When I complained about having too-much work and felt a lot of stress and despair, I stopped and realized that I was lucky to have this great abundance as it\'s a recognition of my hard work. I was commissioned more work because I brought value to someone (or something). From there on, I didn\'t see work anymore as a problem but as a blessing. Who can complain about being her own boss, working whenever she wants and making money? I also lost clients (many in fact). This is what happens when things are taken for granted and you stop making efforts. Every time I lost a client, it was hard for me to accept. And later, I came to understand that there has to be something to be done. Clearly I was doing something wrong. A self-assessment can only be beneficial in work or life in general.<br /><br />On another one, my second son, soon turning one, can only be described as a \'piece of work\'. Ever since he was born, I stopped having a life. He wakes me up several times a night (even now), requires so much attention from me, cries a lot and very loudly. The only way I can calm him is be with him, talk to him, play with him etc. This drains my energy and leaves me flat dead by 8pm. I wanted to be fully present during his first year of life and be there for him in every way. This didn\'t come with any price. I often had nervous breakdowns. I couldn\'t understand my own son\'s needs. And most of the time, I thought this wasn\'t cut out for me. But then, I thought of friends who wish just for finding someone in their lives or have a baby. In fact I was blessed with two. These children require so much from me because I chose to be there for them. Being with them was and still is an investment time for me.<br /><br />During this year, I also had other personal and professional challenges. When I start talking to myself about my problems (yes, I do that!!), I feel ridiculous and small especially when I know people are fleeing their countries because of war or ethnic cleansing. Or because they are not sure to be able to eat tomorrow or the day after. When I have these thoughts, my big problems become laughable and quiet silly.<br /><br />This brings me to think that because I had the chance and the blessing to have all what I have, material and non-material assets, it is my job to give back and share. My job is to bring value and serve others. True, I don\'t like to feel forced or pushed but I know, deep down, that I have something or many things I should benefit others from. It does start with my own children but it expands around me and I hope it gets larger with time.<br /><br /><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PuQYzBwdoSg/WdDA8jQ7UVI/AAAAAAAAWSc/naMNALs3aBo7AzINjR7Atd0UO8SuvPKnACLcBGAs/s1600/size.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="457" data-original-width="404" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PuQYzBwdoSg/WdDA8jQ7UVI/AAAAAAAAWSc/naMNALs3aBo7AzINjR7Atd0UO8SuvPKnACLcBGAs/s320/size.jpg" width="282" /></a>We are truly a connected world and things shouldn\'t just be about us. My eldest told me last week that he didn\'t like cars. I asked him why. He said because they pollute the earth. I said he was right but that in today\'s world, there are electric cars that respect the environment. He asked why then people didn\'t buy that car. I said because they cost more than the regular ones and people didn\'t want to spend all their money on a car. He then said: \'What\'s more important? Saving the planet or not having money?\'<br />This brings me to think that we are born as selfless people. My 7-year-old clearly knows his priorities. They do change, indeed, with time and influence from the society.<br /><br /><b>So, what are your excuses not to bring a positive contribution to our communities, society, country and world? What are your excuses not to create, build, learn, share, volunteer, teach, help and give back? As long as you have a roof over your head and food on your table and visibly power, a computer and an internet connection, your problems are laughable.</b></div>',

    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><br />Most of my recent business lessons are inspired by my own children. They teach me so much about life, way of being and thinking. I find so much simplicity in how they act and behave. They don\'t complicate life. They actually make it simple and find good solutions to what we call \'problems\'.<div><br /></div><div><iframe width="320" height="266" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/UbUoS-RNB88/0.jpg" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbUoS-RNB88?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>In today\'s video, I talk to you about the importance of falling down to grow and be the person you want. Living a life with no risks is not worth living. Staying in your comfort zone can be good for some. But if you have big dreams, it\'s not the place for you to be at. I know for sure, my 11 months-old doesn\'t want to be carried all his life. He wants to start walking and be independent. Every day, he accepts the fall down and failures to learn to stand on his own and start walking.</div><div><br /></div><div>This kid was you and me too. Somehow along the day, we changed...</div><div><br /></div><div>These videos and blog posts are almost a dairy of mine. I remind myself of some of the basic lessons of life and I like sharing them with you.</div><div><br /></div><div>Please watch the video (click on the photo) and subscribe to my channel. I\'d love to see more engagement and comments so I can better answer your questions and inquiries.</div><div><br /></div><div>Keep falling and keep learning!</div></div>',

I barely had any time to do anything else other than the big project I was working on. During all this time, I was feeling guilty not posting videos or new blog posts. So today was finally the day. I filmed a video on the go (as you\'ll see). No preparation, no make-up, no set-up. I filmed in a park while my kid was playing (that\'s why you\'d see me looking up throughout the video/ mom life).<br /><br />The video is short but carries a message I wanted to share with you. Here I am talking about my personal experience with people and who, I feel, my real friends are. As an adult, it can be difficult to find people you can really connect with and be yourself. However, there are some people, who I sometimes meet or get to see again, who give me that feeling of being connected to them and make me feel good about being myself and their friend.<br /><br />Find out who these people are and share your experience/thoughts with me. &nbsp;Also, let me know down below if you like this sort of videos (spontaneous and short). I\'d love to hear from you. Thanks a million for watching my video and like it if you like it ;)<br /><br /><b>Question for you: What are the most special relationships that you love and cherish?</b></div>',

    Title: "Make Every Day Count",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">As June and the month of Ramadan are soon coming to an end, I am starting to feel that we are also approaching the end of 2017. Six months have already gone by and so much in my to-do list seem still unchecked.<br /><br /><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cnE1TL6PnNA/WUvtWe8TaPI/AAAAAAAAWNM/dZxwUVPIPNgqgRae0OXtOlC4YS3fJJHIACLcBGAs/s1600/MAKE%2BEVERYDAY%2BCOUNT.png" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="1080" data-original-width="1080" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-cnE1TL6PnNA/WUvtWe8TaPI/AAAAAAAAWNM/dZxwUVPIPNgqgRae0OXtOlC4YS3fJJHIACLcBGAs/s320/MAKE%2BEVERYDAY%2BCOUNT.png" width="320" /></a>Strangely I am not stressed about it and am in fact more relaxed. Maybe life experience and age help us be more confident about ourselves and definitely calmer. Or maybe big ambitions and goals are beginning to fade away.<br /><br />I hear people all the time complain about how little time they have to play with their kids, visit family or cook dinner. They, surprisingly, find the time to browse Instagram and message all day on Whatsapp. I ask myself why are people lying to themselves. Why do they keep telling themselves they have no time when in fact they do?<br /><br />There is a famous saying that says \'You have as many hours as Beyonce (or Obama etc)\'. True Beyonce and company have teams and people they can delegate to. But you don\'t have to be a celebrity to live a better life and a more meaningful one. In fact, neither you or I need much to be happy and in line with ourselves. Society puts so much pressure on us to purchase, get into debt and live a rat race for the joy of banks and investors. We don\'t need much to be happy.<br /><br />Studies have been conducted and show that happiness comes from our contribution to bettering the lives of others. And yes, it can be a business (businesses help others when they have a clear purpose and a spirit). Studies also show that people tend to remember experiences rather than objects. So the tons of toys you\'re buying your kid won\'t replace the time you\'re not spending playing with him/her.<br /><br />All of these thoughts lead me to think that we should learn to prioritize and reduce our to-do lists to more meaningful actions. Cooking is not a waste of time. It\'s about preserving your health and nourishing your body. Charity work is not money-making lost hours. It\'s about helping others help themselves. Visiting family is not a punishment. You might never know when is the last time you\'ll see them.<br /><br />Make every day count! The exercise I have put in my place ever since the beginning of the year which consists of writing down at least 3 great things that happened to me on the day every day has helped me put every thing into perspective and be grateful for every small thing.<br />Life is not eternal. Make every day count and live it purposefully !<br /><br /><br /></div>',

      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Signing articles in international mainstream media can be such a rewarding thing. But this doesn\'t come without a lot of work and most certainly, offering an added value.<br /><div><br /><div>In this episode, meet Aida Alami, an international reporter who contributes to the New York Times, Newsweek, Al Jazeera and Bloomberg. Her love for journalism started out in Marrakesh where she was born and took her to Colombia University where she studied journalism and made her dream come true.</div><div><iframe allowfullscreen="" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/t8FBiuq3zUk/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t8FBiuq3zUk?feature=player_embedded" style="clear: right; float: right;" width="320"></iframe><br /><br />In this interview, Aida gives so many valuable pieces of advice that apply to aspiring journalists and reporters as well as future young movers &amp; shakers.</div><div><br /></div><div>The main lessons I picked out from this interview are:</div><div><b>1. Know what you want and go for it:</b> Aida knew from the beginning she wanted to do journalism and had a clear vision of the kind of life she wanted to pursue.</div><div><b>2. Practice makes perfect: </b>English is Aida\'s third language and this did not prevent her from writing for big American mainstream media</div><div><b>3. Keep pitching until you get to a yes: </b>Aida approached many publications before some offered her an opportunity to write</div><div><b>4. Have a competitive edge/ added value: </b>Aida knew she could be more valuable in issues related to the Arab countries especially after the Arab Spring</div><div><b>5. Love what you do!:</b> Aida loves what she does and her job is her passion</div><div><br /></div><div>I personally enjoyed interviewing Aida as journalism was for a long time the love of my life and I think, I still am at heart...&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div><a href="https://youtu.be/t8FBiuq3zUk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Watch the video here</a> and share it, if you know someone who could benefit from it.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Let\'s stay in touch!</div></div>',

    Title: "Doing what you love is NOT selfish",
    Content:
      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">So many of us feel frustrated. We do things we don't like and believe that it's being the harsh reality of life. We lie to ourselves saying that 'things have changed', 'it's impossible' and living in the past with our best-friend phrases 'I wish I could', 'If only' etc.<br /><br />We are so consumed by what others think yet we do care very little about what we think. It seems like other people's opinions have so much power on us and that our lives depend on whether the world<br />approves of our thoughts and decisions.<br /><br />While trying to please others, we loose our soul, spirit and sometimes heart. We decide to put our happiness in their hands and pray for their consent.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Sy4ctNHY9uE/WPZUv3rf71I/AAAAAAAAWLw/yju2QPQI-uMKbeoR_h_ddkm58awTA8faACLcB/s1600/JOBBS.jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Sy4ctNHY9uE/WPZUv3rf71I/AAAAAAAAWLw/yju2QPQI-uMKbeoR_h_ddkm58awTA8faACLcB/s320/JOBBS.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a>Life's truly too short to be wasted and I am a fervent believer that there's a way to every problem and situation. If your heart tells you that you should be doing something and it occupies your mind, then this should not be overlooked. As long as it's noble and not hurting anyone or yourself, then you should listen to your guts.<br /><br />I meet a lot of people who wish they could start a business, be independent, live in another country, travel the world, and they find the most articulate excuses not to. I truly cannot judge them. We, for the most part, grew up waiting for the go-ahead of our parents, teachers, spouse(s), bosses and making mechanical thoughts and decisions. Taking ownership of one's life can take time and sometimes it never happen.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Making people happy is important but clearly not at the expense of one's own inner desires, goals and life purpose. A happy human being is able to give far more than just a regular one. One who's fulfilled will find ways to fulfill others, bring value to their lives, improve the living of their communities and societies. Deciding to decide for yourself is NOT selfish. It's a way to dig in for the treasures you're hiding that are yet to be discovered.<br /><br />Cherish yourself. Feel yourself. Be yourself.<br /><br /><b>QUESTION : What's stopping from doing what you love and being yourself? And when would you like to start to live the life you want?</b></div>",

    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5NOcnGIxDGw/WO0PE-2pnoI/AAAAAAAAWLc/XxI0zKDPFewEMwl5yJ8u4oJLzzyCgpOCgCEw/s1600/freud.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5NOcnGIxDGw/WO0PE-2pnoI/AAAAAAAAWLc/XxI0zKDPFewEMwl5yJ8u4oJLzzyCgpOCgCEw/s1600/freud.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>Last Saturday, I was with my boy at the orthoptist. &nbsp;It was an appointment neither I or my son wanted to go to. Getting up and getting ready on a Saturday morning to be at the practitioner\'s office at 8.30am is a bit of a challenge. But we did.<br /><br />While we were waiting in the waiting room, some of the strangest things happened in front of our eyes. A young mom was reading out activities to play to her son. They brought a magazine to occupy him while waiting. She read and explained each exercise. They were the only ones talking in the waiting room. I guess the rest of us were still asleep. At some point, a man asked her to keep it down as he said it was too loud. After a few exchanged words, she continued reading as she wishes. She considered that she didn\'t disturb anyone and continued as she wanted, The man didn\'t hesitate to ask her again to keep it down. All of the sudden, it seemed like a monster came out of the woman. She started screaming and yelling. Everybody was shocked. No one could move. The staff came in and the orthoptist too to settle the situation but the lady continued cursing and all of the sudden, collapsed on the floor. The incident was so painful to watch that my son wanted to leave the place.<br /><br />The next day, I participated at a collective garage sale. I saw some of my dearest items go away and be sold for pennies. At some point, I was almost going to tell the buyer that I changed my mind about selling that teddy bear I had for years or that bag-back I kept since my childhood. But I let myself go through that process. I felt like my subconscious mind needed to let go of some things. It was perhaps because of what I had witness the day before.<br /><br />Our attitude in the world tells a lot about how we feel. If we live in a world of negative thoughts, no matter how polite we are (that\'s what the woman kept on saying when yelling), our emotions can take over and sometimes consume in an ugly way.<br /><br />While it\'s easy to say that one should control his/her emotions, but I believe it\'s a daily job. Working on oneself is a daily task. Many things can be done to brush up the mind and keep a healthy thinking: gratitude exercise, sports, eating well, affirmations... Each one of us is different and each one of us can find things that s/he can do to better manage negative emotions and feelings.<br /><br />That woman got annoyed by the man\'s remark in the waiting room but it was clearly not the reason why she made a spectacle of herself in front of her son and other kids. It was the accumulation and consolidation of weeks, months and perhaps years of feelings. All what that woman needed is to express herself and be heard (she would have been an awful candidate for a hidden camera shooting).<br /><br />Whether it be objects or feelings, I am thinking to seriously start let go of anything that can hold me back. Freeing up my mind just like freeing up my drawers can feel so good. Life\'s simple and we make it complicated. So today, I aim to get more inspiration from children because their world is free of bitterness. hatred, anger and resentment.<br /><br /><b>QUESTION : What is one thing you want to let go of today? And how do you stay calm and collected in difficult situations?</b><br /><br /><br /></div>',

    Title: "Meet children of Shatila refugee camp",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">I am so pleased, beyond happy to FINALLY publish this video. This is one of the projects that I have had for months on my to-do list but never got around to doing it. It was mostly because of the footage which I had to retrieve from a damaged CD. I tried many times transferring the content to my computer and had it jammed several times. After much frustration, last week, I took the CD to a photo laboratory. They managed the whole process smoothly, thing I should have done sooner.<br /><br /><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RQ0JScSaViU/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RQ0JScSaViU?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div><br />Today, I finally finished the editing of the video. I have to say that this brought back so many memories. My visit to the Shatila camp was so moving. My facial expressions can show that in the video. Before that, I have heard about the camp in the news. But being there is a total different story. At the time the video was filmed, I was living in London. My reality had nothing to do with these Palestinian kids\' reality. While I was dreaming of running a successful business. They were dreaming of having a decent roof over their heads etc.<br /><br />I was stunned by, regardless of the harsh life they have, their gratitude toward God and how content they were. Surely they needed many things but their first answer was only that they had everything. In many cases, I had to ask the question several times for them to finally give me an answer to what their needs are. Maybe they don\'t dream. Maybe they are scared to dream.<br /><br />The kids featured in this video must be young men and wo<span></span><span></span>men by now, I deeply hope that their lives have changed for the better. I know that one of them went to Norway and got married there. I hope they have the house they dreamed about.<br /><br /><b>Please comment, share and like the video.</b></div>',

      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3RjbOYj0-FI/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3RjbOYj0-FI?feature=player_embedded" style="clear: right; float: right;" width="320"></iframe></div>This is my first trip with a child and an infant at the same time. Although it was pretty hectic managing the baby, I surprisingly were able to film while having my hands and brain busy. I am trying to commit not to multitask anymore as I find it counterproductive but this time, I really couldn\'t help it. In fact, it\'s been a long time since I published a video and this was an opportunity for me to catch up.<br /><br />The video is short but colorful. I hope you\'ll enjoy it.<br /><br />Please share your thoughts and feel free to comment.<br /><br />Let\'s stay in touch!</div>',

      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N7TlxvAvIoE/WLazJhrw9QI/AAAAAAAAWCE/cp8aGBS97EELFnWS2SxXA3gbdt2erB82QCLcB/s1600/20170228_125129.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N7TlxvAvIoE/WLazJhrw9QI/AAAAAAAAWCE/cp8aGBS97EELFnWS2SxXA3gbdt2erB82QCLcB/s320/20170228_125129.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>Last November, a friend of mine came to visit and brought me a cute mug and a notebook. The mug I knew exactly what it was for. However, the notebook was subject to brainstorming. Most of my notes are taken on a computer or on my smartphone. What would I do with a few hundred pages and a pink-colored hard cover? The answer didn\'t come easy.<br /><br />This year, I decided I am creating my own planner. I pulled out colored pens and jotted down the outline of my calendar and there you go. A few bucks saved but mostly, a very unique and personalized way of organizing my to-do list, thoughts, projects, ideas etc.<br /><br />On the first days of writing down my to-do list for the week, I wrote things I was grateful for on that day. At first, this exercise seemed difficult. Nothing major was happening and I didn\'t consider that day to be exceptionally good. After a few days, the exercise started to get smoother. I realized that being grateful for the day is firstly being aware of each moment and especially the present. My health, my family\'s good health, my food and house were the first things that started to get to my mind. It started to get very basic but these are things we so take for granted. I come from a culture where gratitude is a widely practiced and part of the religion. \'Hamdoullah\' is a commonly-pronounced word. But I came to find that words don\'t have much meaning if they are not accompanied by a meaningful and conscious thought.<br /><br />Putting myself through this exercise daily helps me appreciate the present moment, be aware of the great things that happened and sometimes those that didn\'t happen. This also helps me start the next day with more excitement and enthusiasm. Sometimes I go back to my notes taken in past weeks and read my gratitude points for those days and I feel more positive and inspired for the future. This exercise is to be done every day before going to bed or when checking for the last time your daily to-do list. Miracles may happen!!<br /><br /><b>I urge you to try this exercise for at least a week and see for yourself. Don\'t forget to let me know what you thought of it! Good luck in your endeavors and stay in touch.&nbsp;</b></div>',

Ici, je partage avec vous quelques expériences de TPE/PME marocaines qui proposent des services en ligne plutôt satisfaisants.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>Hmall</b></span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Ici j’avais commandé un iPhone. J’avais peur de me faire livrer un faux. J’avais payé en ligne et ai recu ma commande au bureau. Le site propose également d’autres produits électroménagers, maison, vêtements, accessoires etc. Avantage : Prix intéressants et gain de temps.</span><br /><a href="http://www.hmall.ma/"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">http://www.hmall.ma/</span></a><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Mall en ligne</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Je ne suis pas une adepte du fouinage dans les boutiques. Je préfère regarder en ligne et prendre le temps de lire les reviews etc. Mallenligne me convient parce qu’il y a un grand choix de produits comparables à ceux des magasins de para les moins chers de la ville. Je passe ma commande en ligne (faut créer un compte) et la livraison se fait le lendemain. Avantage : Livraison gratuite et paiement à la livraison.</span><br /><a href="http://mallenligne.ma/"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">http://mallenligne.ma/</span></a><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Khaddar f’dar</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">J’adore ce service. J’envoie un message sur Facebook et hop on m’appelle pour confirmer l’adresse et le lieu et date de livraison. En résumé, j’achète des paniers préalablement conçus pour pas cher ce qui m\'épargne les virées au marché. Ici, il n’y a pas de customisation des paniers. Le panier légumes contient 25kg de légumes variés. Le client ne choisit pas le poids de chacun des légumes. Mais le tout s’élève à 25kg de légumes variés. J’ai reçu pommes de terre, oignons, poivrons, tomates, carottes, navets, fenouil, betteraves, fèves, kharchouf, herbes, citron… Le panier de fruits est également remarquable avec une belle variété de 8kgs de bananes, pommes (je n’aime pas les rouges), kiwi, fraises, oranges, avocat. Prix de chaque panier : 100 dhs. Ce qui est exceptionnellement abordable par rapport à ce que j’ai l’habitude de payer. Avantage : Livraison gratuite et paiement à la livraison.</span><br /><a href="https://www.facebook.com/khaddarfdar/"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">https://www.facebook.com/khaddarfdar/</span></a><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Le Petit Coursier</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Fini les longues queues dans les bureaux administratifs et les courses qui bouffent toute la journée. Ce service me sauve la vie surtout en cette période où je ne sors pas beaucoup. D’autant plus je n’ai plus de coursier à plein temps parce que justement ce service existe. Lorsque j’ai une course à faire, colis à envoyer, documents à récupérer, je fais appel à ce service. Ils m’envoient un coursier et je paie en fonction de la durée de la course et la distance. Avant je payais à chaque course. Aujourd’hui, vu le nombre de courses, je paie à la fin du mois. Avantage : Gain de temps énorme et pas besoin de recruter un coursier à temps plein.</span><br /><a href="http://lepetitcoursier.ma/"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">http://lepetitcoursier.ma/</span></a><br /><br /><b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Carrefour Diététique</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Une fois, j’ai arrêté le lait de vache et avais envie d\'avoir un petit déjeuner aux flocons d’avoine. Seule possibilité : lait d’amande. J’ai appelé ce service et en moins d’une demie heure, j’ai été livrée. Ce magasin/service propose pleins de produits naturels, diététiques comme quinoa, céréales, produits sans sucre etc. Avantage : Plus besoin de faire le tour des magasins pour trouver des produits santé à bon prix.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">http://carrefourdietetique.com/</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Chronoménage</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">J’ai fait appel à ce service une seule et unique fois. J’étais bloquée et avais besoin qu’on me nettoie la maison. J’ai booké en ligne et recu une femme de ménage chez moi. Pour 4 heures de ménage, j’ai payé 120dhs. J’avoue je ne suis pas totalement fan de ce service mais n’hésiterai pas à renouveler l’expérience au besoin. Avantage : Pas besoin de demander à un million de personnes s’il y a une femme de ménage de disponible pour venir faire le ménage une journée.</span><br /><a href="https://www.chronomenage.com/"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">https://www.chronomenage.com/</span></a><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Superdeal &amp; Hmizate</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">J’ai acheté plein de deals de ces sites : séjours en hôtel, téléphones, maquillage, massage, gadgets cuisine, … En livraison, pick-up ou récupération chez le prestataire, l’expérience chez ces deux sites a toujours été positive et je continue à regarder leurs sites régulièrement. Je conseille vivement le shopping chez eux surtout parce qu’il n’y a pas de catch. Parfois j’ai même changé d’avis sur l’achat et on m’avait remboursée. Avantage : De vrais deals sans pièges.</span><br /><a href="http://www.superdeal.ma/"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">http://www.superdeal.ma/</span></a><br /><a href="http://www.hmizate.ma/"><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">http://www.hmizate.ma/</span></a><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Gâteaux, fleurs etc</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">J\'ai également essayé d\'autres services tels que la commande de compositions florales ou de gateaux auprès de Papillon Vert, Linoo Fêtes et Om\'Art.

Avantage : Gain de temps et services assez originaux.</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;">Si vous n’avez jamais eu le courage de vous lancer dans les achats en ligne, je peux dire que les personnes aux manettes des services plus hauts sont conscientes du professionnalisme à offrir à leurs clients et sont sérieuses pour la plupart. J’aime encourager les petites entreprises et surtout celles qui se lancent dans le digital.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;verdana&quot; , sans-serif;"><b>A vous maintenant.

    Title: "I'd love your feedback!!",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Dear You<br /><br />In November 2015, I decided to start publishing videos for YouTube in the areas of business, entrepreneurship and career. It wasn\'t for the fame or the money but I had an urge to share whatever small I had learnt through books and mostly life experiences.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/B2bu5mDLIbE/0.jpg" frameborder="0" height="266" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2bu5mDLIbE?feature=player_embedded" width="320"></iframe></div><br />I had stopped teaching at university for a few years and felt the need to continue sharing through videos and my blog.<br /><br />Today after a year of short video making and around +20 videos in English, Arabic and French, I am coming to you to ask you for your opinion.<br /><br />I\'d be grateful if you could take 5-10min of your time and let me know what you think of the content and format.<br /><br />If you happen to like the videos, I\'d love if you could subscribe to my channel and share the videos.<br /><br />Your feedback is very meaningful to me and I appreciate in advance your time and interest.<br /><br />Look forward to reading you.<br /><br />Thanks and have a wonderful end of year.<br /><br />Safaa<br /><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/safaanhairy">https://www.youtube.com/safaanhairy</a></div>',

    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>It\'s Monday morning. Everyone seems to be rushing in all directions. Traffic jam is bad. Pedestrians are walking fast. People are chasing cabs and buses. Where\'s everyone going? Work, school, yoga classes... Everyone has got some place to go to.<br /><div>It\'s Friday night. Everyone is leaving work with a smile on their faces. Finally, we will find the time to do some groceries, laundry, visit family, go to the hammam, shop and maybe work on that dear project.</div><div><a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IAp5yYXGq1k/WIYqb-Rac9I/AAAAAAAAV_4/2wb1k-GvZWEx_tLmf1hj2WtfK4NvtniqgCEw/s1600/no%2Btime.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IAp5yYXGq1k/WIYqb-Rac9I/AAAAAAAAV_4/2wb1k-GvZWEx_tLmf1hj2WtfK4NvtniqgCEw/s1600/no%2Btime.jpg" /></a>It\'s Sunday night, a feeling of frustration and stress overwhelms our bodies. What\'s happening? Thinking about how the week and the weekend flew by without giving us the chance to do what we wanted to do. Then our brains try to defend us by making up a catch phrase that we\'ll use every time we feel hopeless. \'I don\'t have time\'. We then use it when we feel lazy to go to the gym. We use it when we feel bad about how far ago we visited family. We also say it when we order food rather than make a home-made dinner. In sum, we use it all day long.</div><div>With that said, one wonders what do we have time for then? What are we chasing? What do we really want?<br /><br /></div><div>While being active is very good for the body and soul, being occupied means something else. We can definitely fill our schedules with activities that are completely pointless. My point here is being busy does not mean being productive.</div><div><br />If I get bored I can occupy my mind by browsing Facebook and responding to random statuses. Am I being busy? Yes. Am I being productive? Definitely, no.&nbsp;</div><div>When we want to surpass ourselves and push our limits, we have to be more aware of the best resource we have which is time. We have to learn to manage time, invest in it and get the ROI,</div><div>When we do that, excuses become fewer and meaningful actions increase. &nbsp;But don\'t get me wrong.<br />Resting is a necessity but the question is how much rest do you need to achieve your goals and dreams.</div><div><br />So next time, you go chill at the coffee shop, hit the couch or spend hours watching Netflix, tell yourself, this is time that you have and this is what you choose to do with it. And stop lying to yourself that you don\'t have time!</div><div><br /><br /><br /></div></div>',

    Title: "What I learned in 2016",
    Content:
      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">As I am getting ready to move from 2016 to 2017, set myself new challenges and celebrate, I like to stop for a second and acknowledge the importance of these 364 days of this year. And this is what I believe were the key lessons:<br /><div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l3K98saaizM/WGflHbX-HqI/AAAAAAAAV_c/4QAf4vddOkQHoKKH_7kXn8m-sc_gHOkWgCEw/s1600/look.jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-l3K98saaizM/WGflHbX-HqI/AAAAAAAAV_c/4QAf4vddOkQHoKKH_7kXn8m-sc_gHOkWgCEw/s1600/look.jpg\" /></a></div><br /><b>1. It's good to let go of things that are harmful to you.</b> In 2015 I made some important decisions about my business and wasn't sure where it was going to take me next. I am glad I made those decisions because today I believe that they were the right ones and they helped me so much grow and achieve the things I wanted to achieve. Ironically, some friends believe they were bad decisions and regularly ask me if I regret my decisions and if I am planning to go back the old way. Whatever I say to them to explain my choice, it doesn't seem to convince them, which leads me to my next point.<br /><br /><b>2. Only my opinion counts.</b> I like taking educated decisions and rarely go for something before thoroughly thinking about it. With time, I have come to understand that the most important opinion is mine. I like consulting people and considering different options/solutions, but I never take a decision to please others especially when it's something that it's important to me and will have an impact on my life.<br /><br /><b>3. Patience pays.</b> During my first year of business, I had a real hard time finding prospects and making my business up and running. This year I understood that patience is key to finding new business or getting whatever you want in life. I actually made a video about this. Not getting what you want NOW requires focus and patience. This actually applies to business and life in general.<br /><br /><b>4. Passion is key to happiness.</b> I find that the things I do good at are things I am mostly passionate about. Passion and love help one get through life challenges and difficulties. You can only excel at what you enjoy the most and find interesting.<br /><br /><b>5. Expectations kill. </b>I used to think that every one owes me something. Now that I don't expect others to make me happy or at least to contribute to it, I feel at ease with myself. When you expect things that you don't receive this only nurtures hatred and bitterness. If you want something, work for it and have it. Only you know what you want and know how to make yourself happy.<br /><b><br /></b><b>6. Money is NOT everything.</b> Don't get me wrong, it's good to have money. But it's certainly not enough. Say you have lots of money in your business account but no strategy or business investment to do, then your business is doomed to fail. If you have loads of money in your personal account and no life plans or people to share it with, then it's as if you have nothing. I have lived both experiences. Money is truly a mean and not an end in itself.<br /><b><br /></b><b>7. Not all people are good for you.</b> In 2015, I found myself miserable. The people around me were sucking my energy and creating more unpleasant problems for me to deal with. I decided to end that. Today, I am surrounded by less people but I believe, people who are lifting me up and helping me grow. Whether employees, partners or family and friends, it's important to surround yourself with people who want you succeed and grow. Of course, I had to go through those experiences to learn this lesson. But now I know better.<br /><br /><b>8. Can't succeed without others.</b> In other words, you can't be a success on your own. You need to have a team of people around to help you grow, find new opportunities, live great relationships etc. You may not need lots of people around but you still need some that contribute to your success. One thing is sure is that I realized no one is ever a self-made man/woman.<br /><br /><b>9. There's NEVER only one way. </b>People tend to think there's only one good way of raising children or doing business or whatever. This is so untrue. I sometimes found myself creating new ways of solving problems or doing things. Doing things my way is the true magic of thinking outside of the box. Ironically, I just bought yesterday a book called The 3rd alternative by Convey. I haven't read it but it's definitely what I am going for.<br /><br /><b>10. Helping others feels good. </b>I have to be honest. I hate when beggars ask me for money. I get annoyed. However I have come to realize I love helping when I feel I bring value (time, material goods etc) and connect with the person in need. Sharing and helping are not only good for others but also good for you. I'll definitely work more on generosity in the coming years.<br /><b><br /></b><b>11. Material things aren't fulfilling. </b>This year more than ever, I realized that I am what some people call a minimalist. I decluttered my house at least 3 times/year and gave things I barely or never use. I feel better in a house with less items and objects laying around. In fact, my office needs a huge declutter. Things are overflowing my desk. This is a must thing to do in January '17.<br /><br />It's Dec 31st as I am completing this blog. I am grateful for this great year. Great things happened professionally and personally. I am lucky to have the support of my family and good friends for the moments we spend together. I am also glad I have clients, suppliers and coworkers whom I am happy to work with. They definitely contribute to my well-being and professional development.<br /><br />Wishing the best for the coming year.<br /><br />Happy New Year 2017!!<br /><br /><br /><b>Please comment down below and let me know what is the most important thing you learned in 2016.&nbsp;</b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>",

      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">We all know that books shape our lives. I love reading. It's one of the things I enjoy the most. When I <br /><div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--2lqehnQl4s/WGFkPuAuVuI/AAAAAAAAV_M/ExVvDBElFKUOKkpDRoSLCWyAiePwPRf9gCLcB/s1600/books.jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/--2lqehnQl4s/WGFkPuAuVuI/AAAAAAAAV_M/ExVvDBElFKUOKkpDRoSLCWyAiePwPRf9gCLcB/s1600/books.jpg\" /></a></div>used to be back in Houston, DC and London, I used to spend hours in libraries and bookstores. Paper is still my thing and I can hardly read a book on a screen. I guess I like the smell of the paper I can only get through reading a real book.<br />In this article, I am giving you the top books (in no particular order) that have helped me grow and learn about business and life. I have read many books but these are the ones that made it to the top. This list may get longer as I read more books.<br /><br /><b>1. The Secret: </b>This book was offered to me by my good friend John Purkiss. At the time, I had no idea about what the law of attraction was, although I was actually using it in my daily life. Today to me, this book, written by Rondha Byrne, is a classic and a must-read. It helps you see the world in a total different way and definitely understand that anything is possible.<br /><b><br /></b><b>2. The four-hour work-week:</b> Oh my God! This is like the best of the best. When I read it in 2006, my boss, at the time, thought it was total insanity and didn't even want to hear about it. I find the book yummy. It inspired me a lot to work the way I do now and live the life I have. I am very grateful to Tim Ferriss, the author, for all the tips he shared in his book. Although almost 10 years have passed, the information he gives is still valid today.<br /><br /><b>3. Unlimited Power: </b>This book I have read and bought many copies of that I gave away to friends and family. I urge you to read this book which tackles all aspects of your life from health and business to love and relationships. Needless to say that Tony Robbins is one of my favorite mentors (although I have never met him) and the book is jam packed with useful facts, stories and tips on living your life to the fullest and on your own terms.<br /><br /><b>4. The Success Principles: </b>I find this book very practical and helpful. I like Jack Canfield's style and the stories he shares in this book. The idea is to help you go from where you are to where you want to be. And Canfield does it well helping the reader walk through the steps that need to be taken to achieve goals and dreams. Love this book!<br /><br /><b>5. The Aladdin Factor:&nbsp;</b>This is another Jack Canfield's books that helped me open my eyes about a simple concept which is asking. I won't tell you more because truly this book is an eye-opener on why we don't get what we want. After reading the book (or listening to it like I did), you will use the tools more easily and see miracles happen in your life.<br /><br /><b>6. Brand You:</b> Here John Purkiss talks about how anyone of us is a brand how we should use it to become more visible and memorable. Prior to reading this book, I had never thought that we were brands just like products. This book helped me be aware of everything about and around me which can and does communicate something about me or my business.<br /><br /><b>7. Screw it, let's do it: </b>This book was so inspiring in a way that we see business being done in an usual way. Richard Branson talks about how he started as a student and ended up being an empire. It may sound all unreal in today's world but I enjoyed reading his stories and anecdotes which once again is mind and eye opener. This book will give you some lessons in life and business and inspire you to push your limits.<br /><br /><b>8. All in the mind: </b>Powerful concept that everything starts with a thought. In this book, John Purkiss talks about how our focus shapes our reality, the here and now, the law of unity etc. After reading this book, I have understood that nothing is either black or white. Our minds and thoughts shape our reality and we should create the right environment for good thoughts to take place and work in our favor. Easy read!!<br /><br /><b>9. The Secrets of selling:</b> If you're looking for a good sales book, this one I believe is the bible of sales books. Geoff King gives practical tips and information on how to conduct meeting, write a sales pitch, meet prospects, find new business, talk to the media etc. It's a reference book that I love having in my home library.<br /><br /><b>10. How to win friends and influence people:</b> This book was recommended to me by a local Moroccan bookstore seller. This isn't the type of books I would usually pick up but he convinced me that it was a good read. Having done a degree in communication, most of the things Dale Carnegie talks about are a deja-vu in my courses but it's still a good refresher and principles one should apply daily for successful relationships.<br /><br /><b>11.&nbsp;The Contrarian's Guide to Leadership:</b> Steven Sample writes about the qualities of a leader and stresses on the importance of having an open mind and be able to listen to successfully manage others. In a world where true leaders are lacking, this book offers great advice on decision making and action-taking that could be implemented on a daily basis. Great read!<br /><br /><b>12. Rich Dad. Poor Dad:&nbsp;</b>I looove this book. In a time where I was wondering how do people make so much money and enjoy freedom, Robert Kiyosake came to answer my questions in his book. Here I learned about active and passive income, assets and liabilities and the cashflow quadrant. The sooner you will read it, the more time you'll save.<br /><br />I am looking forward to reading next the <b>Tools of Titans </b>by <b>Tim Ferriss</b>. I need to find a way to get it shipped here.<br /><br />Let me know if you have favorite books that impacted your life. Comment down below and let's all share the knowledge!<br /><br /></div>",

    Title: "How to run a business from anywhere in the world",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 16pt; text-align: left;">There are so many advantages to running a business remotely. You can work off your couch or on an island sipping mojitos and still run a successful business. If you’re wondering how to do that, <a href="https://youtu.be/jFq_Z3rXD6c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">watch my video</a>and read on.</span></div><div style="text-align: center;"><div style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em; text-align: center;"></div><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe width="320" height="266" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/jFq_Z3rXD6c/0.jpg" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFq_Z3rXD6c?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><span style="font-size: 16pt; text-align: left;"><br /></span></div><div></div><ol style="text-align: left;"><li><b><span lang="EN-US">Get the right equipment and tools:</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> To get started and work from anywhere, you need to have the basics: a good laptop, a very good internet connection and some helpful apps. You’ll also need a phone for urgent communication.</span></li><li><b><span lang="EN-US">Think of a business that can be run from anywhere or redesign your business:</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> If you want to start an online business, that’s a no brainer. It doesn’t need your physical presence anywhere specific for it to run.</span></li><li><b><span lang="EN-US">Hire freelancers:</span></b><span lang="EN-US">&nbsp; Outsourcing is a huge thing. Tim Ferriss talked about it more than 10 years ago in his book ‘The Four-hour workweek’ and it’s still relevant today. You can hire people you’ve never met in your life and who’d still deliver quality work. By hiring freelancers, you could have them on board on a Friday night for a project to deliver on Sunday and they wouldn’t complain. It offers so many advantages on top of the fact that they can work while you sleep thanks to time zone differences.</span></li><li><b><span lang="EN-US">Batch, batch and batch:</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> This is to me one of the skills I had to learn as an entrepreneur. Doing a task every single day when it can be batched can be such a time-waster. For example, why banking every time you have an operation to make when you can schedule a specific day for it to deal with all bank-related matters?</span></li><li><b><span lang="EN-US">Get disciplined:</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> Being your own boss and not having reports to make to anyone can be tempting to slack off and stay in pjs all day watching Netflix. When you choose to work from anywhere you still have to have a schedule and plan your days ahead. Productivity will be your goal as any time wasted equals money not earned.</span></li><li><b><span lang="EN-US">Network:</span></b><span lang="EN-US"> Whether online or offline, you still have to make new relationships or maintain existing ones for partnerships, collaborations etc. Working from anywhere means you have to make an extra effort to socialize and meet new people.</span></li></ol><div><a href="https://youtu.be/jFq_Z3rXD6c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">To watch the video, click here.</a></div><div><br /></div>Let\'s stay in touch and please comment below!<br />Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/safaanhairy<br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/safaanhairy/<br />Twitter: https://twitter.com/safaanhairy<br />Instagram: http://instagram.com/safaanhairy<br />My blog: http://safaanhairy.blogspot.com/<br /><br /><div></div><br /><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: &quot;Times New Roman&quot;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; margin: 0px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px;">Website: http://www.imediart.ma</div></div>',

    Title: "Today is the day",
    Content:
      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">It's that time of the year where I sit, look back at the 11 past months and reflect. Only this time it's different. I am stunned at how quickly time flies by. We always complain about the lack of time and how we don't have time to do anything. We don't have time to work out. We don't have time to visit family. We don't have time to read. We keep postponing important decisions or actions and believe that one day we'll get to them. Excuses, excuses and more excuses,<br /><br /><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-krGEW9SuUWw/WEmfvjrwoAI/AAAAAAAAV-E/zQUpAvsnOsAdwBET9QhojOFoAW9OFK2EACLcB/s1600/today.jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-krGEW9SuUWw/WEmfvjrwoAI/AAAAAAAAV-E/zQUpAvsnOsAdwBET9QhojOFoAW9OFK2EACLcB/s1600/today.jpg\" /></a>Why excuses? Not only we suck at time management and productivity skills but it's a lie. We do have time. We'd just rather spend hours on Facebook than do something uncomfortable. &nbsp;In fact, our time's limited. In Morocco, I often hear a popular saying: 'God's days are long' in other words, if not today, there will be plenty of other days. I recently came to realize that this isn't true... How?<br /><br />My two-month-old baby's newborn clothes don't fit him anymore. Prior to giving birth, I had purchased and received a ton of newborn clothes from everywhere. Different garments for different occasions. Today, my son cannot wear these clothes anymore. This is a pure indication that time passes and there's no going back. The baby's journey is even more deep as he's started from nothing, just an embryo, to becoming this 5-kg baby only in a few months.<br /><br />I don't mean to stress out because I am getting old (er) or because time is going by. But this is, to me, a wake-up call that if we keep postponing something in our lives, we may never find the 'perfect time' we're looking for.<br /><br />Our future is NOW. Our results are TODAY's actions. Let's not wait for that 'day' or 'year' to visit our loved ones, run our own businesses or travel the world and do the things that are important to us. Today's the best time we'll ever have.<br /><br />While you reflect on that, I'll go pack the baby's clothes and find another one that's ready to come to this world who can hopefully make use of them.<br /><br />Best of luck to you all and hope you make the most out of the rest of this year!!<br /><div><br /></div>Safaa Nhairy<br /><br />Let's stay in touch and please comment below and tell me what you do to seize the day.<br />Youtube: http://www.youtube.com/safaanhairy<br />Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/safaanhairy/<br />Twitter: https://twitter.com/safaanhairy<br />Instagram: http://instagram.com/safaanhairy<br />My blog: http://safaanhairy.blogspot.com/<br />Website: http://www.imediart.ma<br /><div><br /></div><br /></div>",

I also take you to Essaouira, a city known to surfers from all over the work. I find Essaouira special as it\'s a small city on a beach side, not much happens there but it\'s still one of my favorite places in Morocco. Perhaps the hippie and laid back lifestyle is what I like :)<br /><br />Not too far from Essaouira, there is Sidi Kaouki. If you\'re not a surfer, you can still enjoy the beach, riding a horse/camel and enjoy the beautiful terraces in front of the ocean.<br /><br />This plan is really great for whoever wants to rejuvenate, relieve stress, not look at the watch and travel back in time :)<br /><br />I let you watch the video and please comment, like and share if you liked it.<br /><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe width="320" height="266" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3ys9sR60JHY/0.jpg" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ys9sR60JHY?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br /><br />Don\'t forget to subscribe to the channel to keep tuned!<br /><br />See you soon<br /><br />Safaa<br /><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;tahoma&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;freesans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;">Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/safaanhairy/</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;tahoma&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;freesans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;">Twitter: https://twitter.com/safaanhairy</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;tahoma&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;freesans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;">Instagram: http://instagram.com/safaanhairy</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #333333; font-family: &quot;arial&quot; , &quot;tahoma&quot; , &quot;helvetica&quot; , &quot;freesans&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 14.85px;">My blog: http://safaanhairy.blogspot.com/</span></div>',

    Title: "Things to do during Ramadan",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div>The worst thing about Ramadan is that some people spend their days waiting for Maghreb to break their fast and spend their nights going out and catching up on food they haven’t had throughout the day. Ramadan doesn’t have to be a frustrating time. In fact, if we occupy our minds with good actions, we’ll have a better and more fulfilling time.<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OEuO5Gy_BCY/V1v94v-8fHI/AAAAAAAAU-s/CUKjHciSjJQj55W7brbXIHyMH879zMdLgCLcB/s1600/Blog-Post-10-Time-Management-Tips-for-Ramadan-slider1.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="231" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OEuO5Gy_BCY/V1v94v-8fHI/AAAAAAAAU-s/CUKjHciSjJQj55W7brbXIHyMH879zMdLgCLcB/s320/Blog-Post-10-Time-Management-Tips-for-Ramadan-slider1.jpg" width="320" /></a></div></div><div><br /></div><div>Here are some things you can do during Ramadan:</div><div><br /></div><div><b>1) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Read &amp; learn: </b>If you have some reading to catch up on, with the Iftar time being so late, you have so much time to do read and learn new things. Commit to at least half an hour to learn more about a field of interest; whether it’d be religion, science or crafting, reading and learning should be on your daily to-do list.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>2) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Cook: </b>You always complain about eating out and not having time to cook. What a better time to brush up your cooking skills?! Make sure to plan out ahead your meals and to include fruits and veggies in your Iftar. Planning, shopping and cooking require some time and planning your meals ahead will keep you away from unnecessary food intakes. Also, why not try new recipes? Diversify your food and learn to be a chef in your own kitchen!</div><div><br /></div><div><b>3) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Declutter:</b> With so many things getting piled up throughout the year, Ramadan is the perfect time for decluttering your drawers, closet, office space and kitchen. You’ll find you have so many things you don’t need and that can be donated to the needy. Plus you’ll get more free space and you’ll feel better. Your personal computer may also need some software updating, anti-virus installing and folders reorganizing.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>4) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Feed the poor:</b> Rather than giving them money, why not prepare a bunch of bags where you’d put milk, dates, bread and some other goodies that you’d distribute in your area for the poor to break their fast? This is a very satisfying action that will not only help them but help you grow as a person as you’ll take the time to shop for them, prepare the bags and distribute them.</div><div><br /></div><div><b>5) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reconnect with nature:</b> Food being one of life’s distractions, enjoy this time of the year to go to the beach or the forest to breath fresh air, hear the ocean waves crash or the birds chirp. Being in touch with nature will make you feel very small and almost insignificant and sometimes we need that kind of feeling not to be too comfortable on earth and amplify our ego.</div><div></div><div>Other things to do:</div><div><b>6) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visit family and friends</b> (and it doesn’t have to be always after Iftar)</div><div><b>7) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Workout</b> (good for the health and the soul)</div><div><b>8) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pray and meditate</b> (be grateful and thankful for what you have and talk to God openly)</div><div><b>9) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Reflect and plan </b>(vacation plans, business plans? What’s your strategy for the upcoming months?)</div><div><b>10) &nbsp; Back-up your data</b> (Are all your photos, videos, documents safely stored? Or are they in random USB sticks that you can’t find?)</div><div><b>11) Plan your next vacation: </b>Do the necessary research to plan a vacation that\'s different from all your previous ones<br /><b>12) Major in a new field:</b> You can have an MBA without leaving your home. Study current business trends, success stories, research and learn how to apply new learnings.<br /><br /></div><div>Wishing you a wonderful and spiritual Ramadan wherever you are. Ramadan is not just about abstaining from food, it’s time to reconnect with yourself and work on being a better person.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ramadan Mubarak to all!!</div><div><br /></div><div><b>How about you? What do you do during Ramadan? How does it help you or help the people around you? Please comment and share.</b></div></div>',

    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><span style="text-align: left;">I meet so many people, from different backgrounds and ages, who often have great business ideas and sometimes big dreams but who would never take the plunge. Why? Because of that fear of failure holding them back. It\'s interesting to see how the word \'failure\' have such an impact on us and actually can limit us to explore our potential and help us grow. Yes, no one wants to fail. In fact, most of us want to succeed with a minimum of pain. But the reality is much different than that.</span></div><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><iframe width="320" height="266" data-thumbnail-src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/KkJHYwo9jCY/0.jpg" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KkJHYwo9jCY?feature=player_embedded" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div><br />In this interview, Kenza Bennis, founder of Kenzy Beauty, an argan-based cosmetics line, talks about how she manages the fear of failure on a daily basis. She explains what she does to keep herself focused and goal-oriented while meeting challenges and obstacles.<br /><br />This was a great interview packed with tips. Please watch, share and comment. Let us know what is holding you back to do what you want to do? And what is your biggest fear.<br /><br /><a href="https://youtu.be/KkJHYwo9jCY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">To watch the video, click here</a></div>',

    Title: "How to make room for creativity (and limit distractions)",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">You feel like you haven’t been very productive these past few weeks, months or year? Perhaps it is due to some of your habits that hinder your ability to create, experiment, invent and grow and mostly have fun.&nbsp;</span><br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUFpqifzYFc" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img border="0" height="179" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-CYAMTCdupsw/VpTM6MjcvAI/AAAAAAAAU0I/J2qCyx7qs_8/s320/Creativity%2Bthumb.png" width="320" /></a><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">If this year you have decided to get back on track, then here are 5 tips that can help you reduce distractions and empower you to give the best out of yourself.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">1.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Plan it out!&nbsp;</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Just like you plan to work out or to go to the bank, you need to have slots in your calendar where it says ‘Thinking’, ‘Researching’ or ‘Creating’. If you keep yourself busy throughout the day, you are not left with much energy to produce, create and come up with new things/products. Make it a habit to challenge yourself and never consider these activities as a waste of time.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">2.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Control your information intake&nbsp;</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">As we go through the day, emails, Whatsapp, Viber, Facebook notifications are popping up. Certainly not what helps to get ahead efficiently in your day. What you should do is first declutter your social media accounts and keep only the pages/groups/friends you’re interested in. &nbsp;Remember a group you’ve signed up to 4 years ago may not be of interest today. And you don’t have to keep accepting what does not concern you anymore.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">3.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Determine frequency/duration of email checking/Social media browsing</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">The average person has five social media accounts and spends around 1 hour and 40 minutes a day on social media. That’s huge!! Facebook, for example, can be very interesting if you’re using it as a tool to promote your brand or business. And it can only be a total time waster. If your job title is not community manager, then you shouldn’t be spending all your time on social media. Fix a time of the day you want to check your accounts and limit it to a certain period of time.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">4.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Turn off notifications on your phone/ipad</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Nothing is more annoying than a series of sound notifications urging you to check the messages and respond to them. The all-day-long beeps will kill your creativity and leave no room for inspiration. &nbsp;Turn off the notifications and sometimes you may also have to turn off your phone to be able to go deeper in your thoughts.&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><b><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">5.<span style="white-space: pre;"> </span>Choose one of two tools where you can be reached at and let people know about it.&nbsp;</span></b><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Your clients, partners and friends should know what your preferred tools of communication are (normally phone and email). Let them know of that. If they try to reach you via Whatsapp or Skype, they may be able to receive a message from you telling them: ‘If your enquiry is urgent please phone me. Otherwise, I’ll get back to you when I’ll get to see it’. &nbsp;</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">‘Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it.’</span><br /><span style="font-family: Helvetica Neue, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;">Henry Ford</span><br /><div><br /></div><div><b>Let me know your thoughts and if you have any other tips you can share!!

First it was the office move then the home move. Yeah that\'s a lot for someone staying in the same city. People ask me what drove this big change.<br /><br />Well I have two answers: 1) Sometimes everything works out so well that the change makes sense and things fall into place naturally 2) Change is good. It can be a good decision if you\'re not getting the results you\'re expecting where you\'re at.<br /><br />Speaking of the second point, if you remember my last post, I had described how I lived walking to the office (Sorry that was in French only) and how painful that was too me and how it affected my mood. In my new neighborhood, fortunately, I am confronted with a lot less than that. I can finally walk like a normal human being and can even enjoy going to a small park and sit there without being approached or insulted. Strangely, I feel much better. I am not sure if it\'s the placebo effect but whatever it is, I am better now and my family is too.<br /><br />Change can be scary because we all like being in the confort zone. Changing habits, friends, neighbors, concierge, shops can be annoying but when the alarm goes off, you have to listen and go for the new things. They might not be better but it\'s definitely a new experience calling you.<br /><br />Go for it. </div>',

J\'ai la chance de travailler à près de 250 mètres de chez moi ce qui rend la marche encore plus faisable.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Durant ces 6 minutes de marche, tous mes sens sont réveillés.

Si c\'est le cas, j\'ai droit à une douche matinale des voisins qui trouvent du plaisir à nettoyer leurs balcons le matin et donc à se débarrasser de l\'eau sale coulante du haut. Je me trouve contrainte de faire des zigzags sur un pseudo-trottoir pour éviter une douche d\'eau noire et malodorante.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Marchant quelques pas, je rencontre une famille de chats. Avant, je ne voyais qu\'un chat noir somnolant. Aujourd\'hui et depuis quelques semaines seulement, il est accompagné par d\'autres chatons. Ahh c\'était une femelle et la famille s\'agrandit.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Je décide donc d\'éviter de déranger le bien-être de ces chats qui occupent le trottoir et traverse la rue. De l\'autre côté m\'accueille une étendue d\'ordures dont une bouteille en plastique contenant un liquide orangeâtre, je n\'ose même pas deviner ce que c\'est. Le pas enchainé comme un militaire, je prends la rue perpendiculaire et voilà qu’une odeur d\'urine insupportable m\'envahit et me perce les narines. Je décide de passer de l’autre coté mais je traverse au mauvais endroit. Un autre immeuble avec de l\'eau sale coulante. Aieee !!!<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Soulagée que bientôt je vais prendre la grande avenue et que je pourrais respirer de l\'air plus clean, je trouve au tournant des crottes de chien. Réflexe bien développé, j\'évite de marcher dessus.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">A ce moment, je sais que ma route sera plus facile. Je n\'aurais plus à prendre de ruelle. Cette avenue mène directement à mon bureau. Je marche droite, avec certitude mais en regardant le sol pour éviter le regard gênant des passants. Plongée dans mes pensées sur la ville et son état, je me fais prendre le bracelet élastique par un clou se trouvant dans la boite arrière d’une moto, stationnée sur le trottoir, ce qui m\'oblige à faire marche-arrière pour sauver mon bracelet.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Je continue et hop, des travaux au salon de coiffure occupant tout le trottoir. Je traverse de l\'autre côté, un mendiant m\'attend... Une liste de douaa/prières. J\'accélère la cadence et continue. J\'évite le marchand de fruits occupant le centre du trottoir et hop je traverse encore. Une dame assise devant la boulangerie me voit de loin et commence avec ses prières. Cette dame a grandi devant cette boulangerie et maman lui avait déjà proposé de travailler mais elle avait refusé.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">A ma gauche un libraire, enfin l\'odeur de la civilisation et de l\'avancement, pas le temps de trainer, je continue mon chemin. Un monsieur assis sur un carton, sur le trottoir, tenant son journal est là. Après toutes ces années, je ne sais pas ce qu\'il fait là-bas, ce qu\'il vend etc. Un jeune délinquant un torchant à la main et le reniflant me demande l’aumône. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Mon téléphone portable sonne. Je l\'ignore et je traverse. Deux gros bacs à ordures m\'attendent avec une étendue de déchets. Je perçois un homme perché tête dans la porte du bac. On ne voit que la moitié de son corps. Je dévie le regard et traverse. <o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Pendant ce temps, un accrochage entre voitures donne lieu à un concert de klaxons répétitifs me perçant le tympan des oreilles.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Dans ce chaos, un dragueur commente mes formes et mon teint de peau.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0in;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">J’accélère la cadence.

Le cœur battant. J\'essaie de retrouver mes clefs, je regarde à droite et à gauche si je suis suivie. J\'entends le bruit des clefs mais je ne les retrouve pas.

J\'ai essayé plusieurs fois d\'adopter des méthodes pour rendre mon chemin plus agréable : visualisation, affirmation, positivisme... Il en faut beaucoup pour feindre, ne pas voir la réalité. Même avec les lunettes de soleil et la tête baissée, je suis quand même provoquée par les odeurs et sons insupportables.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0in 0in 0.0001pt;"><span lang="FR" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Je pleure Casablanca où je suis née et ai grandi.

      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">'Is that all there is?' sometimes I ask myself.<br /><br /><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IWu4jA0CK1Y/VXlOl0EWuXI/AAAAAAAAUlw/vupF7009fsA/s1600/stress.jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IWu4jA0CK1Y/VXlOl0EWuXI/AAAAAAAAUlw/vupF7009fsA/s1600/stress.jpg\" /></a>I am very good at goal-setting and list writing. I have so much satisfaction jotting down my to-do list and scratching over a goal when achieved. However, sometimes, I feel there is something more than just 'contact that client' or 'deposit that cheque' or 'pay that bill' to life. We get caught in a rat race and never get the time to reflect so we can put our lives on the right track.<br /><br />I have friends whom I call because I haven't heard from them in a while. They say they're swap with life problems and are too busy. I wonder what they're chasing up. I wonder if they take the time to reflect and give meaning to what they do.<br /><br />We can either fill our time with loads of activities and things to do or we can choose the right occupations that are in line with our purpose and reason-to-be. Now that I am writing this, I am also giving the answer to my own question. I guess this is not all there is.<br /><br />Life's more than just about going to work, paying bills, and going to the grocery shop. Life has a deeper meaning that each of us need to discover within ourselves. Life cannot be about chasing up money and constantly looking for material gains.<br /><br />So let's slow down a bit. Yes it's possible even for those in big cities and let's start giving more meaning to our life and savor each present moment. <br /><br /><br /><br /></div>",

    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">Récemment, j\'avais rédigé un post sur les animaux des rues. Aujourd\'hui, je suis dans l\'obligation de reposter sur ce sujet vu la dernière nouvelle de maltraitance et de torture du pauvre chien Ray.<br />Ray a été retrouvé au quartier Lissassfa à Casablanca la gueule cousue et les yeux arrachés. Non, pas possible que cela soit un autre chien qui lui ait fait ca. C\'est l\'oeuvre d\'un humain. Un humain qui manque d\'humanité.<br /><br /><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xChiT7-qF3w/VW7gHav4XjI/AAAAAAAAUlU/HSkSpSGOrLQ/s1600/petition-img-14477-fr.jpeg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="182" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-xChiT7-qF3w/VW7gHav4XjI/AAAAAAAAUlU/HSkSpSGOrLQ/s320/petition-img-14477-fr.jpeg" width="320" /></a>Ray a été recueilli de la rue puis conduit chez un vétérinaire pour analyser sa situation critique. Aujourd\'hui, il est sous traitement et sous surveillance.<br /><br />Il parait que l\'auteur de ce crime s\'adonne à de la magie noire et que mettre dans la gueule du chien je ne sais quoi, la coudre et arracher les yeux est un rituel pour contrôler son mari pour qu\'il ne regarde pas ailleurs. J\'ai du mal à croire à ce degré de cruauté envers un animal innocent.<br /><br />L\'opinion public demande à ce que justice soit rendue. Ce pauvre Ray, nommé après Ray Charles, a droit à une vie et est aujourd\'hui le symbole de la maltraitance des animaux dans ce pays.<br />Nous voulons qu\'une personnalité politique se prononce à ce sujet et mette en place un code pénal pour toute personne qui porte atteinte à un animal sans défense.<br /><br />En attendant ces jours glorieux, merci de signer la pétition et de la partager avec un maximum de personnes : http://www.mesopinions.com/petition/animaux/justice-ray-animaux-maltraites-maroc/14477</div>',

    Title: "Each day, make someone smile :)",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">I am one of the fervent believers that we\'re all here for a reason. And above all, we all have one common \'reason to be\'. Funny that how \'we\' includes here people from all walks of life, religions, ethnicités, races and income. \'We\' here refers to humankind as a whole.<br /><br />I recently gave myself a challenge. I made it my job to help or make someone\'s day every day. That means each day, I help someone I know or just someone whom I come across to. For no reason.<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kLhabAwCwkw/VVNpoFoD76I/AAAAAAAAUkA/F3hS3WzXCAo/s1600/you-dont-need-a-reason-to-help-people.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kLhabAwCwkw/VVNpoFoD76I/AAAAAAAAUkA/F3hS3WzXCAo/s320/you-dont-need-a-reason-to-help-people.jpg" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />I can either render a service or help with some money or phone them or surprise them with a present.<br /><br />With this \'every day\' habit, I feel less selfish and less about me and my family but opening up to others. It does bring some sort of satisfaction and makes you feel here for reason : helping the ones in need. Yes, I am willing to help but who helps me? you\'re going to tell me. Sometimes I ask myself the same question, but I tell myself that I should be grateful that I am able to help and that I have physical, mental and financial ability to do so. Also, I do believe in karma :)<br /><br />With that said, I am far from being perfect. I am working on myself to improve a \'no judgment\' spirit as to whom I give to. A lot of times, I find myself judging the mendiants by the way they dress or how they speak and abstain myself from giving them some coins. I know that mendicity has begun to be a lucrative profession. However, helping should be free from judgments.<br /><br />While I am working on myself, I\'d like to hear from you. In what way do you help people around you?<br /><br />See you soon.</div>',

Vous allez me dire que vous n’êtes pas une multinationale ou une grosse boite … je vous dirai qu’il n’est pas nécessaire d’avoir une entreprise pour penser à son image de marque.<br /><br />Rappelez-vous votre dernier entretien d’embauche. Au-delà de vos compétences et de votre merveilleux CV, vous n’avez peut-être pas reçu l’offre que vous souhaitiez parce que ‘l’image’ que vous reflétiez portait des messages mal conçus. A contrario, pensez à une autre situation dans laquelle vous avez été complétement synchro avec votre interlocuteur.<br /><br />Pour la plupart, cela se fait naturellement sans trop y réfléchir. Mais aujourd’hui, au vu de la concurrence qui existe, le marché de l’emploi saturé et un marché des affaires très concurrentiel, nous ne pouvons plus prendre de risque. Votre image de marque parle pour vous sans même parler. Pour reprendre une expression anglophone : ‘Ca n\'est pas la personne que vous connaissez qui importe mais plutôt celle qui vous connait…’.<br /><br />Les outils de communication, devenus démocratisés, sont à la portée de tous. Mais de nos jours pour sortir du lot, il faut un peu plus qu’un compte Linkedin et une belle photo. Au cours de la formation que je donne, je présenterai des techniques qui vous aideront à être plus conscient de votre marque. vous apprendrez à construire une image de marque en adéquation avec vos attentes. Vous apprendrez à communiquer autour de cette image afin d\'atteindre vos objectifs. Une image de marque soignée optimisera vos chances de convaincre vos partenaires professionnels. Une image proche des attentes de vos prospects et clients les séduira et sera déterminante dans la réflexion qui les conduira à vous choisir parmi vos concurrents.<br /><br />Je vous invite donc à nous rejoindre le 13 mai 18h à Casablanca.<br /><br />Pour en savoir plus sur notre formation, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/493288824156396/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">visitez notre page FB</a> ou appelez-nous au 0522 29 38 29.<br /><br />A très vite !<br /><br /></div>',

    Title: "Sauvons les animaux de nos rues !!",
    Content:
      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">Depuis que j'ai voulu accueillir un chat chez moi, j'ai découvert toute une communauté d'amoureux des animaux à Casablanca. D'abord, suite à une question posée sur un groupe de femmes sur Facebook, on me propose l'adoption plutôt que l'achat d'un chat, un concept qui me paraissait encore nouveau. Suite à cela, je découvre @PetFinder Casablanca un magnifique groupe qui fait tellement en terme de sauvetages de chats et de chiens des rues.<br /><br />Il est impossible de circuler dans les rues de Casablanca sans s'apercevoir du nombre de chats de gouttière et de chiens errants. Ils se font renverser par des voitures, sont abandonnés et la rue est leur seule issue.<br /><div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nTvue91kA08/VSVOHffqMTI/AAAAAAAAUXg/PuEMAmR2oLc/s1600/cat_paw_print.png\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-nTvue91kA08/VSVOHffqMTI/AAAAAAAAUXg/PuEMAmR2oLc/s1600/cat_paw_print.png\" height=\"284\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Le travail que fournissent les groupes tels que PetFinder est énorme. Même l'état n'en est pas capable. Le sauvetage est pris très au sérieux et l'appel aux famille d'accueil ou adoptants se fait rapidement via les réseaux sociaux. Un formulaire est envoyé aux candidats adoptants à renseigner avec des informations utiles sur ce que cela implique d'adopter un chat/chien. Une fois rempli et envoyé, une personne appelle le candidat pour lui remettre l'adopté.<br /><br />Le groupe est aussi très présent par rapport au soutien de l'animal ainsi que de son adoptant. Je me souviens lorsque j'ai pris la petite Kitty il y a un peu plus d'un mois, elle n’arrêtait pas de miauler et je ne savais quoi faire. Un soutien énorme m'a été fourni pour me rassurer et me permettre de la garder. Je dis parfois en rigolant que même lorsqu'on paie, on n'a pas quelque chose un service d'une aussi grande qualité.<br /><br />Aujourd'hui la petite a un peu plus de 2 mois et a déjà de la compagnie : un chaton d'un mois sauvé de la rue que j’accueille en famille d'accueil (une idée de Pet Finder Casablanca pour laisser mon chat bien vivre sa phase agitation et jeu).&nbsp; Au fond de moi, j'ai envie de garder ce deuxième chaton. Qui sait ? ;)<br /><br /></div>",

d’idées de projets, des rêves, un ras-le-bol du quotidien etc. Que font-ils pour changer la situation&nbsp;? Rien. Elles passent beaucoup de temps à se plaindre sans pour autant réfléchir à la chose et élaborer un plan de travail pour atteindre leur objectif.</div><div><br /></div><div>Ce constat me pousse à organiser des mini-formations pour aider ces personnes à booster leur enthousiasme et à les guider vers comment monter leur projet.</div><div><br /></div><div>Il est très difficile de s’auto-motiver lorsqu’on est entouré de salariés mal dans leur peau, des proches qui croient que l’entreprenariat est dangereux et risqué et lorsqu’on n’est pas sûr de soi. L’idée de ce séminaire que j’organise le 15 avril à Casablanca est d\'initier  justement ces personnes au concept de l’entreprenariat, ce que cela demande, ses challenges et avantages. Aussi, au cours de cette formation, nous allons passer en revue toutes les étapes pour monter un projet à partir d’une passion, un hobby. Souvent, ces mêmes personnes ont envie de se lancer mais ne savent pas quoi faire ou dans quel domaine opérer. Les possibilités sont illimitées et au cours de cette formation, nous nous limitons à ce que le futur entrepreneur aime déjà.</div><div><br /></div><br /><div>Cette formation vise à vous aider à&nbsp;:</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">• Découvrir la passion qui sommeille en vous</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">• Formaliser cette passion en activité professionnelle</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">• Evaluer le marché afin de mieux cerner la viabilité de l’entreprise</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">• Planifier les actions à entreprendre</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">• Surmonter sa peur de l\'échec</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">• Exemples concrets de projets : success stories</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">• Brainstorming: donner naissance à une affaire rentable à partir d\'une passion</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">• Communiquer et transmettre sa passion aux autres</div><div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">• Evaluer le degré de connaissance qu’il faut avoir dans la gestion d’une entreprise </div><div style="line-height: normal; margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0cm;">• Apprendre comment ne pas se laisser décourager</div><div><br /></div><div>Cet événement sera également l’occasion pour les futurs entrepreneurs de nouer des connaissances et de tisser des liens.

    Title: "Hitchcock : Célébrer le Maître du Suspense",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FkDuczkzDfg/VOd1uXUexFI/AAAAAAAAUTM/To0qmRpc-VE/s1600/BFW-Poster-Final-v2%2B(1).jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FkDuczkzDfg/VOd1uXUexFI/AAAAAAAAUTM/To0qmRpc-VE/s1600/BFW-Poster-Final-v2%2B(1).jpg" height="320" width="226" /></a></div>Quatre films muets réalisés par Hitchcock dans les années 1920 et récemment restaurés par le British Film Institute, seront diffusés pour la première fois au Maroc lors de la Semaine du Film Britannique 2015 à Rabat, Agadir et Tétouan. Ce spectacle inédit des premières oeuvres du maître sera accompagné d’un cinéconcert musical joué en direct par le talentueux pianiste du cinéma muet:<br />Stephen Horne .<br /><br />La quatrième édition de la Semaine du film britannique est organisée par le British Council Maroc en<br />collaboration avec le CCM (Centre Cinématographique Marocain), le Cinéma 7ème Art, l’Institut Français d’Agadir, l’Université Ibn Zohr, Universiapolis, l’Université Abdelmalek Essaidi, la Faculté des Lettres et des Sciences Humaines de Tétouan, l’association Biddayat et le cinéma Avenida.<br />Hit Radio est le partenaire officiel média de cet évènement.<br /><br />L’évolution d’Hitchcock en tant que cinéaste à l\'époque du cinéma muet est essentielle à la compréhension de son style de cinéma, très tôt salué comme un génie. Le public et les critiques ont été captivés par son mélange audacieux de styles d\'édition européens, combinés avec la composition dramatique et un mélange puissant de l\'humour lacé avec une grande tragédie.<br /><br />La restauration du «Hitchcock 9 » constitue le plus grand projet de restauration que la BFI ait jamais<br />entrepris, et dont la réalisation est devenue possible grâce à la nouvelle technologie numérique. La BFI détient certaines copies des plus importants et plus anciens films muets d’Hitchcock, y compris les négatifs.<br /><br />Après, une comparaison minutieuse scène par scène est effectuée avant que ne commence le travail<br />photochimique, suivi d\'une restauration numérique (image par image). Ce procédé nécessite de grandes connaissances dans le domaine des conservations, couplées d’une grande expertise technique. Le but de ces restaurations est de rendre les oeuvres d\'un des plus grands artistes de la Grande Bretagne appréciées sur grand écran tout en respectant la façon dont elles étaient destinées à être regardés. En outre, ces restaurations ont non seulement montré les films de manière plus nette et plus fraîche que jamais, mais ont aussi apporté de nouvelles interprétations. La restauration de films muets d\'Hitchcock a révélé un matériel supplémentaire et mis à nu une meilleure appréciation du génie précoce à l’oeuvre.<br /><br />Concernant Stephen Horne, le musicien du film muet a longtemps été considéré comme l\'un des principaux accompagnateurs de films muets. Basé au BFI Southbank de Londres, il a mis en musique des sorties DVD, des projections télé de la BBC et des installations muséales de films muets. Bien qu’il soit principalement pianiste, Horne ajoute souvent de la flûte, de l’accordéon et du synthétiseur dans ses performances, parfois simultanément.<br /><br />De plus, et afin d’offrir au public marocain une appréciation complète de ces joyaux cinématographiques, les facultés de lettre à Agadir et à Tétouan organiseront u ne série de conférences et d\'ateliers a utour de la vie et des oeuvres d\'Hitchcock, présenté par le journaliste cinématographique et conservateur I an Haydn Smith.<br /><br /><b>Dates</b><br />22-25 Février : Cinéma 7ème Art, Rabat<br />26 Février 1er Mars : L’institut Français, Agadir<br />25 Mars : Cinéma Avenida, Tétouan<br />Le HITCHCOCK 9 : (Date de sortie 1926 – 1929)<br />The Pleasure Garden (Le Jardin du Plaisir) (Mars 1926)<br />The Lodger: A Story of the London Fog (Les cheveux d’or) (Sep. 1926)</div>',

Pas de transparence. Achats de vote des candidats. Nombreuses excuses sont données pour justifier le non-vote.<br /><br />La campagne de \'Mantsayadch\' de Hit Radio a contribué à ce que je change d\'avis sur ce sujet. Après tout, on peut toujours voter blanc. Nous sommes tous présents quand il s\'agit de se plaindre de l\'état de nos rues, les ordures, la mokata3a (l\'arrondissement), la police, la justice etc. Que faisons-nous pour changer les choses ? Comme a dit Ghandi, "vous devez être le changement que vous voulez voir dans ce monde." Si on en a assez de voir des ordures par terre, arrêtons de les jeter sur les trottoirs. Si on en a assez de vivre le non-respect des automobilistes, respectons le code de la route. Si on en a assez qu\'on nous demande des pots de vin, acceptons de payer l\'amende. Si on en a assez de tout, faites-le savoir avec bien plus que des paroles.<br /><br />J\'aime beaucoup la chanson \'Mantsayadch\' car elle résume un peu l\'état d\'esprit du marocain. Heureusement, le jeune marocain d\'aujourd\'hui est conscient que le changement est plus que nécessaire et urgent. En attendant que vous vous inscriviez aux listes électorales,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.listeselectorales.ma/">https://www.listeselectorales.ma/</a> profitez de cette chanson et surtout partagez-la :<br /><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOlCituaXFA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOlCituaXFA</a></div>',

A lot of videos on Youtube show different ways of making the flourless pizza. The way I make it is I steam cauliflower for about 15min. I then smush it with a fork, add an egg, salt and pepper and mix everything. The dough is ready. Lay it on a plate and put it in the oven for about 15-20min.<br /><br />Take it out the crust from the oven. Now you add whatever you like: tomato sauce, mushroom, tuna, pepper, cheese etc. And put it back in the oven until ready.<br /><br />Enjoy it and let me know what you think ;)<br /><br /><br /></div>',

    Title: "How to make your passion a lucrative business",
    Content:
      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\">A lot of people ask me how to make the leap and start their own businesses. Now I must say. It's true that it can be hard to leave the comfort zone and start life from the 'beginning'. But let me ask you this, if you were to continue doing what you're doing, would you be happy? If the answer is no, then let's move on.<br /><div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TqcMNxdZf3E/VLOlhAjNfNI/AAAAAAAAULY/gUMJDZWCDjU/s1600/leap.jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TqcMNxdZf3E/VLOlhAjNfNI/AAAAAAAAULY/gUMJDZWCDjU/s1600/leap.jpg\" /></a></div><br /><b>1. Decide to leave your comfort zone: </b>You must be willing to accept the changes in your life. This can be cutting off your daily Starbucks' or spending less on clothes and accessories. As you become your own boss, you should switch your attention from you to your business. Every penny should be invested in your business. Are you willing to forget about yourself (some a year at least)?<br /><br /><b>2. Be willing to take risks:</b> We take risks all the time. Even by staying at your current job, you are taking a risk. I prefer taking an educated risk. If you're prepared to take the leap, then smile to the word 'Risks'. Are you ready for new challenges?<br /><br /><b>3. Determine what makes you joyful and what you love doing naturally:</b> If you're not sure what kind of business you want to launch, think about what you spend doing during your free time and how that can become a business. A friend of mine loves baking. She quit her job at a bank to start a cupcake business. Got the picture? What's tour passion?<br /><br /><b>4. Make a plan (business): </b>A dream without a plan is just a dream. Make a plan with actionable objectives. Set 3 things to do a day that are going to get you to where you want to be. Remember there's no overnight success. Persistence and hard work are the key to making your dream come true.<br /><br /><b>5. Just do it!!:</b> I know a lot of people who spend years doing research and looking for statistics on percentages of success and failure of businesses within the first years. I personally don't really care much about these numbers nor let them influence my mood. If I set my mind to something, then I'll do it. If you really want to have your own business then stop dreaming and start acting. Do it as soon as you feel it's right. Trust me. You'll never regret it.<br /><br />Now one last thing I must say is that entrepreneurs already have a DNA that's leaned toward leadership and creation/creativity. Entrepreneurship is not for every one. It's for the people who believe they are truely bringing an added value to their clientele.<br /><br /><b>NOW TO YOU: Do you have any experience or stories to share? How did you make the leap? Where are you in your thinking mode? Answer below.&nbsp;</b><br /><br /></div>",

As I was conversing with her, I realized that it\'s true that our \'old days\' seem to be more fun than our daily lives. We are so into working, doing, shopping, driving, etc that we forget what playing is and how being cool feels. <a href="http://safaanhairy.blogspot.com/2014/12/what-i-did-in-2014.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This links to my last blog post of how I spent 2014.</a><br /><br />Being an adult doesn\'t have to be serious all the time. Being fun and funny spices up life and makes it more interesting. I love watching how spontaneous children are. I don\'t need to look very far. My very own child is so full of life and plays for most of his time. It certainly helps develop his brain but it also sets up his mood. He\'s for most of the time happy and smiling.<br /><br />This year, I decide to be more easy-going and have fun like a 4 year-old. Why make life complicated when it can be simple and enjoyable.<br /><br />Happy New Year everyone!</div>',

Days, weeks, months fly before our eyes when we suddenly stop and wonder why we\'re always in a rush, always stressing out, always running from one thing to another.<br /><br /><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n6ISdXIx8t0/VJ01bIeVkrI/AAAAAAAAUKA/lVsSzTt_l-8/s1600/idea3-final-web-ready.jpg" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-n6ISdXIx8t0/VJ01bIeVkrI/AAAAAAAAUKA/lVsSzTt_l-8/s1600/idea3-final-web-ready.jpg" height="271" width="320" /></a>2014 is coming to a close. If I had to summarize my year, I\'d say it\'s been a hectic one. But why? Not sure. So much to do... Is it right to say we\'re ambitious and this justifies our crazy lifestyle. What have I been doing all this year? I feel so tired... What did I see/visit? Who did I meet?... God, I don\'t have answers to these questions. Perhaps I need time to answer. I know why I can\'t answer them right now. I am thinking about what I am going to do next and about what I am going to do after that.<br /><br />Oh there you go. This is how I actually spent my year; always planning for the next thing. Sadly this comes with missing out on the important things and enjoying the present moment.<br /><br />One week till the New Year. I better slow down the pace and stop and smell the roses before 2015 is here.<br /><br />Good year everyone!</div>',

    Title: "I am thinking you're not thinking...!!",

      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">I was recently hosting a meeting at my office. It was one of those meetings where everyone participates, gives ideas, shares thoughts etc. The room was buzzing and each of us was excited to offer his/her insight on the subject matter.<br /><br />At some point, I am hearing my colleagues agreeing on an idea that has just been offered. Everyone seemed happy with the decision when I hear: \'Safaa, what do you think?\' \'Why you\'re quite?\'. I said: \'I am thinking\'. They smiled and continued discussing and then came back to me quickly asking again if the decision was okay with me. At that moment, I still haven\'t formulated a complete idea before for me to give an answer.<br /><br /><a href="https://sitebuilderio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/elizabethking/uploads/2010/06/thinking_critically.gif" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="217" src="https://sitebuilderio.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/elizabethking/uploads/2010/06/thinking_critically.gif" width="400" /></a>This is to say that yes it\'s good to be a quick thinker but sometimes it\'s okay to need more time to fathom a new idea, digest it and then accept it. Saying \'yes\' from the beginning without comprehending the idea and the consequences of its application didn\'t seem to be the right thing to do. Yes it may look good to be actively participating at a meeting but when I need a break to think, I am not going to deprive myself.<br /><br />More and more people, it seems like, are focused on actions rather than on the thinking which makes me think of what Henry <br />Ford once said:&nbsp;"Thinking is the hardest work there is, which is probably the reason why so few engage in it."<br /><br />I am not here to give lessons but I believe that if something is not understood, don\'t rush to give an answer to impress people or to do just like others. Give yourself the time to think or ask for more information that can help you decide.<br /><br />In this type of fast-food life, let\'s take the time to think and the energy would be use up wisely.<br /><br /><b>PS : Thinking is good. Over-thinking is BAD for you. ;)</b><br /><br /><b>QUESTION : Are you a fast or slow thinking? How do you come to a decision?</b></div>',

    Title: "It's my right that you read this blog post right now!!",
    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><br />Being a business owner, I often come across young graduates looking for internships and jobs. Sometimes I interview them for jobs we offer at the agency. Young people I encounter have most likely gone to school, received higher education and have big dreams of conquering the world. All classic!! However, one thing I have noticed in common among these graduates is this sense of entitlement. \'I am interning at this insurance company. They\'re using up my time. They should pay me.\' or \'I have a higher degree and I won\'t accept a job if they don\'t give me a salary with bonuses etc\' or even \'Sorry I have a higher degree, I cannot open the office door.\'<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-39tV8GXmREM/VA7EYlPLX9I/AAAAAAAAT1Q/3cORC5K6oMA/s1600/tumblr_inline_myl0pvDfQQ1qzxlbn.gif" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-39tV8GXmREM/VA7EYlPLX9I/AAAAAAAAT1Q/3cORC5K6oMA/s1600/tumblr_inline_myl0pvDfQQ1qzxlbn.gif" height="135" width="320" /></a></div><br />Because they have being to school and received a degree, these young people feel the world owes it to them. We all know that in most cases, employers don\'t really care about the degree. It\'s more about can you do the job and can you do it well. Having a degree is a mere way for filtering applications and looking deeply to those profiles who have a degree and experience.<br /><br />I remember when I was going to school, I had decided to do an internship outside of my class hours so I could acquire experience. This was not required for my degree. But I enjoyed doing it although I wasn\'t paid for it and went through tough times. I was feeling so lucky and grateful for being an insider and working in institutions where I could learn and do something I loved: communication and media.<br /><blockquote><span style="background-color: white; color: #181818; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">“You have to do your own growing no matter how tall your grandfather was.”&nbsp;</span><br /><span style="background-color: white; color: #181818; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;">―&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/show/229.Abraham_Lincoln" style="background-color: white; color: #666600; font-family: georgia, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px; text-decoration: none;">Abraham Lincoln</a></blockquote>The right to have something or entitlement can be a hot debate when it comes to the business and work world. I have acquired higher education and have degree but am I entitled to having the biggest clients in the world and charging big fees for my services? No. No, until I work really hard to convince these \'Biggest clients\' that I am the right choice for them and when I will never disappoint them and always deliver high quality work to their standards.<br /><br />I believe entitlement is not healthy. The moment you expect something, you always feel disappointed. &nbsp;There are indeed some basic rights to be respected but none should feel \'special\' because none is really \'special\'. When you think you are \'special\' there is so much pressure that you put on yourself: you have to have this, you have to get this, you have to receive this treatment, etc. It\'s a lot of expectations. When one doesn\'t have much expectations but work toward his/her goals, whatever s/he receives is a good surprise and a reward.<br /><br />My advice to the young adults starting out in their lives: don\'t demand anything. Work hard and prove you deserve what you want!<br /><br /><b>QUESTION: And you, how do you feel about entitlement? Do you think your parents, the government, the system, the boss should owe you something for nothing? Share your comments below.</b><br /><br /></div>',

      "<div dir=\"ltr\" style=\"text-align: left;\"><div style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HBhAmLWAFGk/U7qBewZns4I/AAAAAAAASAk/wYcASuBVDkU/s1600/images+(3).jpg\" style=\"clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HBhAmLWAFGk/U7qBewZns4I/AAAAAAAASAk/wYcASuBVDkU/s1600/images+(3).jpg\" height=\"135\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>I was recently having a conversation with a friend who was complaining about how she doesn't have any help at home and that she hated all that house chores from cooking to cleaning etc. She spoke about the subject passionately and I could feel how she felt about it all. She also explained that she couldn't find anyone to give her a hand and that the potential candidates didn't want to work during summertime.<br />Basically what I understood is that she's stuck. I could almost recommend her moving to a hotel room and being taken care of but I knew that wasn't an option.<br /><br />This made think about a good piece of advice that I heard in one of the audiobooks. Wayne Dyer said: 'If you're not doing what you love and loving what you do, you have 2 choices to make: 1) change what you're doing or 2) change how you feel about what you're doing.<br /><br />I believe that the second option is extremely powerful. While there's so much vibe about 'leaving your job and doing what you love etc', changing how you feel about something you don't enjoy is just as powerful. It can actually save up so much bad energy and negative feelings. It can make you from do something you hate to do something you quite enjoy, it can help you make your day go smoother and happier...it can be a secret ingredient to life happiness. Because let's face it, we don't always do what we love and this can definitely help us get going with a smile on our faces.<br /><br />I am not very much familiar with NLP but I suppose that's what it is: programming your mind to love something that has previously programmed in your mind with words such as 'I hate', 'I don't like' etc. I guess it works just like a PC. You program it with the wrong software. You overwrite the software and install a new one.<br /><br />At the end of the day, all the beliefs we hold about anything have been a thorough programming of the mind. Changing your thoughts and directing them to what you want can not only be a fun exercise but also can help with living life with less hard times and less conflicts with one's self.<br /><br /><b>Have you ever 'programmed' your brain?</b><br /><br /></div>",

While this isn\'t new information, it made me think about how our habits and lifestyle are changing...<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Any young and active person can hardly spend a day without checking his/ her Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, LinkedIn and Instagram accounts (to say the least). Have you ever calculated the amount of time you spend on each of these websites? Additionally you may have favorite apps you like to get on daily.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Last week, I was at a conference and one of the speakers was proudly telling me that he receives between 200 and 300 emails a day. He added that just on the short lapse of time we talked he received 2 missed calls already. Honestly, I thought there was nothing to be really proud of... I did mention to him that while I was having a conversation with him, my phone was in my bag and I was not taking any calls right at that moment as it would be a lack of respect and at the same I prefer to be fully in the moment rather than trying to deal with new issues... I also thought to myself that I did good implementing my New Year resolutions (unsubscribing from all the lists that didn\'t interest me anymore).<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">This is to say that when our day is filled with checking websites, chatting with friends online, playing games on apps etc., we are not creating; we are not adding value but merely consuming. &nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">I think 70% of the time should be dedicated to creating/ producing. The 30% can be utilized for inspiration, information consumption and chatting (not networking).<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Tim Ferris was right when he said we should check our emails only once a week at the same specific time. Of course for young professionals and entrepreneurs, this seems like forever but why not try to implement it on a more or less doable manner.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">By freeing ourselves from Facebook, Twitter, Instagram mania, we can spend more time thinking, creating and adding value to other people\'s lives.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt; text-align: left;"><b><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">What about you?

In fact, none of us has any excuse to make for not having succeeded or not being on the path for a greater life.</div><div style="clear: both;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both;">While ages ago, only Kings could own, buy and rule the world, in today\'s world, everyone is a King. We say knowledge is power and I say it\'s true. Knowledge doesn\'t necessarily mean going to school and getting a PhD. Knowledge and education, in my opinion, is knowing that you can learn anything that you want, be anyone that you want to be, have anything you want to have and basically create and live the life you want. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</div><div style="clear: both;">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div style="clear: both;">Today\'s biggest and top secrets of the world\'s richest, smartest and most fulfilled people are revealed. We can no longer ask: \'What did he do to become so successful?\' or \'How does she make so much money?\' We know every single habit of highly successful people - the information is available anywhere and everywhere.</div><div style="clear: both;">Mere knowledge is not going to get you (or me) anywhere if it\'s not followed by actions. I could know the formula for resolving a math problem and think/ believe I can easily solve it but does it guarantee me I will successful find the right answer? Most probably NO. Practicing is part of getting to the point you want to get to.</div><div style="clear: both;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both;">I hear sometimes people complain about the job market, the economy, the crisis, the government etc. We can certainly blame the world for all the things we don\'t have. But what can we do to overcome these challenges and take control? Sometimes we feel / get stuck. It\'s completely normal. But what\'s not normal is to drop everything when you really badly want to achieve something. I see on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram so many statuses of inspirational quotes and words of wisdom. YouTube is full of tutorials and videos/ stories of successful people. The information is out there waiting for you/ us to read it, chew it, digest it and turn it into an actionable plan.</div><div style="clear: both;"><br /></div><div style="clear: both;">The question remains what\'s your definition of success?</div><div><br /></div></div>',

Every new year resonates with new resolutions and objectives. People always ask : ‘so what are your resolutions this year?’ Resolutions are a great way to push oneself toward the set goals .</div><div><o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div>I personally have been very good at setting lists of resolutions every year. And throughout the year I would go back to them and re-evaluate, check the developments and try to motivate myself to stick to them. I have done this for years. I have indeed achieved some of the goals and failed at some others.<o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div>In the real world, we see people going from one side to the other, working long hours, looking for bigger paychecks and bonuses, aiming for the latest car model, the latest smartphone, getting into debts for buying a big house and even for a family vacation…. The question that comes to my mind when I see all this is do their goals and achievements make them really happy? Is getting a loan for buying a bigger or more luxurious car contributes to inner happiness? <o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div>Of course, every one of us is different. Our perception of life is and should be different. If going after a better paying job and more responsibility is what brings us real happiness and serenity, then okay. <o:p></o:p></div><div>I think we should be careful when we set life resolutions and goals. When we make a list, do we set goals for our real selves or do we fix objectives that will give us reassurance and validation from the society?<o:p></o:p></div><div><br /></div><div>For this year, it’s taking me longer to come up with my list. In fact, as I see, as I get older the less long my resolutions list is and the more meaning I try to add to them.<o:p></o:p></div><br /><div><br /></div><div><b>What’s your resolution this year ?</b><o:p></o:p></div></div>',

It is often overlooked as we live in a society that does encourage talkativeness and noise. You may have guessed which skill I am talking about... Yes it\'s listening skills.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">I remember growing up people telling my mom how quiet I was and how little I talked. They related that to shyness. I don\'t know what it was really - since later on I studied communication and taught it as well and kept on being the same. But when I was little, I knew that by talking I didn\'t learn much but by listening I was absorbing all what I was hearing, observing and even feeling.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">In this recent trip to London, I realised that people are so absorbed by themselves and their lives that they truly don\'t have sufficient space in their heads to hear about other people\'s problems, stories etc. I was hanging out with this person who for the entire time we spent together led every point of the conversation to talking about her, her life and problems. I found it at the beginning difficult to carry on any sort of discussion with her. But as the problem became bigger to my eyes, I decided not to place any more word (as it was a waste of my energy) and kept you nodding or saying \'mmm\'. The less I spoke the more open the person has become.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Listening works perfectly in the professional world as well. Dealing with a confrontational client, I find it more convenient not to say any word but just listen. As I listen I take note of what\'s said and at the same time, I give the opportunity for the other party to expression him/herself and let it out.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Many proverbs and citations encourage thinking before speaking. It\'s undoubtedly an invaluable advice. So many times we end up saying something we regret afterwards or let something that shouldn\'t be said slip away.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Genuine listening is always followed by thorough thinking. And let\'s not forget that listening is the foundation for any good communication.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><br /></div><div style="margin: 0cm 0cm 0.0001pt;"><span lang="EN-US" style="font-size: 13.5pt;"><b>What about you?

I have a girlfriend who always complains about how her husband does not bring gifts to her and spoil her. I have another friend who always expects something back when he offers help to someone…&nbsp;</span></div><div>The examples are countless, which leaves me thinking about what makes us ‘unhappy’.</div><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US">Usually when we’re unhappy, it conveys a feeling that what we expected didn’t happen. In other words, when we expect a gesture, a present, a feeling that we don’t t receive, we become unhappy.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US">The question is why do we expect anything to begin with?<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US">I think we expect things because when we offer help, help or do a favor to someone, we do it with a premeditated goal (receive something back in the future). We rarely do something out of generosity, love, etc. Mothers are a good example. When they feed, diaper, play with their babies/ children, they certainly not expect anything tangible in return. We call that an ‘unconditional love’. &nbsp;A mother who does not receive the same amount of attention and affection from her child will continue to love him/her, no matter what.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US">My point is landing a hand is firstly good for us, for our soul and presence on this planet. It gives us more sense of life. It makes us feel special and needed.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US">When we make dinner or help a friend move, expecting a ‘thank you’ or a restaurant invitation ruins all the magic of life. If the other person didn’t do anything, you’ll start looking at her in a different eye and maybe start avoiding her etc. Expectations create frustration, stress and disappointment.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US">Of course, you don’t want to be used but that expectation does not help either. Why expect when you can live life and be truly surprised and pleased.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US">So for me, on my birthday, expecting nothing from my family members was the best thing I could do. Every single thing I have received on my birthday was an amazing surprise and celebration. I didn’t expect a birthday cake, a card, a present or all the attention and love. And I got all of them and felt happy receiving them. It was definitely not their ‘duty’ to do so that’s why I appreciated the gesture and the surprise.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US">It’s challenging but I will try to apply the learnings and benefits of this lesson on the rest of aspects of my life.<o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US"><b>And you, do you always expect things back when you give a hand?</b><o:p></o:p></span></div></div>',

Lorsque j’ai créé Hakoo avec l’aide de mon équipe, j’avais comme vision de faire des cartes de vœux l\'outil de communication par excellence des marocains pour créer de la joie, de la bonne humeur et raviver les sentiments de leurs proches.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0cm;"><br /></div><div style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin: 0cm;"><span style="font-size: 13.5pt;">Aujourd’hui, Hakoo est toujours à ses débuts mais est sur le bon chemin.

Looking back I think I was beautifully naïve. Today with the university years way behind me, I cannot judge my success or failure based only on my academic and technical skills. While we invest so much time and money into acquiring degrees and skills, professional life is much more concerned with something else. Something that doesn’t necessarily require you to be the best, something simply called people skills.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US">There isn’t one single person on this planet that has achieved a tremendous amount of success without the help of others. Getting people to join you, adhere to your vision, follow you and help you get ahead is one of the most difficult things to ever be learnt. I now understand why they don’t teach this stuff in schools. Additionally, leadership classes are taught but at a very late age when the person has already misconceptions about life, limitations and prejudices. Teaching kids how to lead themselves and others, how to initiate projects and excel at communication would enable all to be healthy and sound from an early age. But of course, we don’t want everyone to be a leader!! &nbsp;A leader must have followers. Else there is no point in being a leader.<o:p></o:p></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US">If there is one thing I recommend young students and professionals to spend most time on is soft skills : skills not taught in schools but acquired in the real life. <o:p></o:p></span></div><br /><div><span lang="EN-US"><br /></span></div><div><span lang="EN-US">And you, what is the best thing you’ve learned outside of school?<o:p></o:p></span></div></div>',

As we are in the Eid Adha season, things are now quiet. Shops are already closed. People have left the cities to join their families. Nothing is happening in the business world...<br /><br />As I am thinking about the projects I am working, I am wondering why some have been unsuccessful. The word unsuccessful here is used in the way that people have not given me a response or haven\'t manifested any interest as of now. To me, I have been using all possible ways to convey the information and persuade them of the relevance and worth of the given project. They may also have asked for meetings or more information, But as of now no sign of hope...<br /><br />I wonder if when we people don\'t respond or don\'t give a definite answer I should consider this a failure. Should I hear the unspoken and read the unsaid? Strangely, I am one who doesn\'t give up until the person expressly say it. But this does not work all the time.<br /><br />Doing business is like an art. It is indeed a complex process that depend on several things not just on the financial gains... The feeling of being unsuccessful can negatively impact the work process and the results. This is why it is important to know that we cannot succeed at every thing and that failure is a step forward to success. In fact, Edison has failed 9999 times before creating the light bulb. Edison isn\'t the only example. Most successful business people and great people have failed before finally enjoying the success they were looking for.<br /><br />In the process of failing, it is good to remember that there is always a lesson there to be learnt...<br /><br />And you, how do you feel about success and failures? Are you indulgent with yourself when you fail?<br /><br /></div>',

When I first read this, I thought that was a crazy idea…<br /><br />In fact, creating an inconvenience is actually taking yourself out of your comfort zone and pushing yourself to reach new goals and levels. It builds your character.<br /><br />It may seem like self-flagellation but the idea is that the more you do of something you dislike the easier it gets and the better you become as a person.<br /><br />The first ‘inconvenience’ I have tried and done this week was taking a cold shower. While at first, I just couldn’t even run the water on my feet now I have a little more courage and less anxiety when jumping in the shower. I can already notice, having done it 3 times now, that it is getting easier and more fun. I am focusing less and less on the cold water and putting more attention to enjoying the shower. The bonus is that I feel really good after taking a cold shower.<br /><br />Other inconveniences I am starting to create in my life is taking the stairs, ditching the car and using my legs… Of course, the inconvenience does not have to be physical. It can also be controlling the time you spend watching TV. It can also be limiting your interactions on Facebook and the number of times you check your email.<br /><br />I find this exercise interesting and very challenging. I am sure it can only be beneficial.<br /><br />Are you up for it?</div>',

But I know, I am not the only one and have to keep on until 11pm/12am. WHY? Because I am a woman.<br /><br />Women are expected to be everywhere. At the office, earning some money, at the grocery shop, buying stuff for the house, at family reunions, solving problems, in the car, picking up the kids, at home, breastfeeding and baking… Being a woman is far from what Marylin Monroe portrays.<br /><br />Of course, there are women fully enjoying their femininity, time and keeping the nails shiny and polished but that’s not most of us. Most of us are just mad!!! We had hard time or maybe didn’t even have the choice to pick the life we want. Do we want to have a loving husband and a family? Or do we want a successful career? Or be a good housewife and mother? Or do a job we’re passionate about? Or earn personal money and have some savings? Or travel the world and explore new horizons. Well of course, we want it ALL.<br /><br />We are ready for no sacrifice. We jump from a business meeting to the cleaner to going back making lunch to then the office to picking up the children, to going back to the office…I am not finishing this thought because it’s too long.<br /><br />So if we are tired and exhausted, I think that’s understandable. Many of us who are superbusy women and moms also decide that with all the things they have to do, they still manage to get massage appointments, go to the hammam, the hairdresser and find time for themselves.<br /><br />I am a woman myself and I am stunned at how much women can do. I think they should be called magicians.<br /><br />In these tough times, women find less and less help. Sisters, cousins, aunts, everyone is busy with his/her own life. The woman has to do it all by herself facing daily challenges and solving daily problems.<br /><br />To all women out there, you are beautiful magicians!!<br /><br />___<br /><br />And you, what are the challenges you face on a daily basis? Please comment below.</div>',

If you are into healthy lifestyle, this is for you...<br /><br />I am not sure I can call it a \'recipe\' as it\'s a 2-ingredient recipe and really it couldn\'t be any simpler.<br /><br />Ready? You\'ll need, to make these amazing and tasty pancakes, 1 banana and 2 eggs!!!!<br /><br />You start by peeling off a ripe banana and then mush it with a fork. You then add to it the 2 eggs. Mix everything and get the pan ready with some oil. Pour some of the mix on the pan. Flip it when ready. And voilà!! Your pancakes are ready.<br /><br />Verdict : It was so good that no pancake was left.<br /><br />Why I love this recipe more : 1) It didn\'t have any sugar or flour 2) It takes 2 min to do and 3) no mess in the kitchen or loads of dishes required!!!<br /><br />Oh one thing, I actually sprinkled some cinnamom on top on the pancake but that\'s optional.<br /><br />I suggest if you are more than one to use 2 or 3 bananas. As an experiment yesterday, I only used one but the more the merrier.<br /><br />Enjoy and let me know what you think of it...<br /><br /><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">Let’s talk on :</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/safaanhairy?ref=hl" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; color: #1f2d61; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">https://www.facebook.com/safaanhairy</a></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><a href="https://twitter.com/SafaaNhairy" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; color: #1f2d61; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">https://twitter.com/SafaaNhairy</a></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><a href="http://instagram.com/safaanhairy" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; color: #1f2d61; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">http://instagram.com/safaanhairy</a></div></div>',

I now use my feet to go to work (of course I don’t live too far from my workplace), do light shopping, go to the post office, pay my bills and meet people. Of course, I will use my car for when I need it. But today is actually the 5thday without using my 4-wheel engine. Surprisingly I feel lighter and free (I thought people bought cars to have more freedom).<br /><br />My morning, noon and evening walks is the best thing for me as I am certainly not a gym person and I have meant to go work out by the sea with a friend for ages but never got to do it. So, there I am, no car but have managed to be somehow active.<br /><br />The second thing I am working on is eating healthier. In a way, I am glad I don’t have house help (this won’t be for long). Because now I can make our meals and think ahead of what we are going to eat and even try to find the healthiest recipes. I am not a good cook but I must say stuff I have made so far have all been consumed. Don’t know whether it is because it’s tasty or just because there’re empty stocks that need to be filled… I am happy to find so much information and new recipes on youtube and the web. They make our lives so much easier!!<br /><br />While I am happy I have somehow been good this week, I am not sure how long I can keep sticking to my resolutions. &nbsp;I will just have to pray to keep it up and stay motivated…<br /><br />One thing is sure. I have no car waiting for me outside. I am definitely walking home from work this evening.<br /><br />How about you? Are you having a healthy lifestyle? How did you manage to change your habits?<br /><br /><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">Let’s talk on :</div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/safaanhairy?ref=hl" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; color: #1f2d61; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">https://www.facebook.com/safaanhairy</a></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><a href="https://twitter.com/SafaaNhairy" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; color: #1f2d61; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">https://twitter.com/SafaaNhairy</a></div><div style="background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times, serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.8em; margin-bottom: 15px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"><a href="http://instagram.com/safaanhairy" style="background-color: transparent; border: 0px; color: #1f2d61; margin: 0px; outline: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;">http://instagram.com/safaanhairy</a></div></div>',

Je profite de cette période pour ré-organiser mes idées. Voici quelques conseils que je suis et que je vais partager avec vous pour bien réussir sa reprise :<br /><br />FAITES UN TRAVAIL QUI VOUS PASSIONNE. Il serait malheureux de passer des journées entières dans un travail qui ne vous donne pas satisfaction. Certes, il y a des personnes qui n’ont pas le choix à cause de contraintes financières (On en parlera dans un prochain article) mais si vous avez des compétences et de l’expérience, ne gâchez pas votre vie à faire un métier ou à travailler dans un environnement qui ne vous plait pas.<br /><br />ORGANISEZ VOS JOURNEES A L’AVANCE. Trop de spontanéité ne vous mènera pas très loin. Un minimum d’organisation et de planification est nécessaire pour accomplir vos taches et atteindre vos objectifs. &nbsp;Rendez-vous chez le dentiste, visite familiale, etc, ca se programme à l’avance.<br /><br />CONSACREZ-VOUS DU TEMPS. Souvent lorsque nous sommes trop pris, nous nous négligeons. Nous passons nos journées au bureau puis il y a les courses à faire, le diner à préparer, les tâches ménagères, les enfants etc. On tombe le soir comme un sac fatigué et exténué. Il est donc nécessaire de vous accorder du temps et ce tous les jours. Cela peut être un bon film ou livre avant de dormir, un petit massage, une tasse de chocolat chaud. Bref c’est le moment de la journée où vous vous chouchoutez (idéalement après avoir accompli toutes les taches de la journée).<br /><br />INTEGREZ LE SPORT, UN HOBBY DANS VOTRE PLANNING. Nous nous trouvons toujours des excuses pour ne pas faire ce qui nous fait plaisir. Si depuis longtemps vous souhaitez apprendre une nouvelle langue, levez-vous et allez vous inscrire au centre de langue le plus proche de chez vous. Si vous vous plaignez de fatigue permanente, sortez vos baskets et allez marcher ou faire vos cours de gym. Si vous aimez le piano, il n’est jamais trop tard pour apprendre etc. Les bienfaits d’une activité sportive ou créative sont innombrables.<br /><br />NE REMETTEZ JAMAIS A DEMAIN CE QUE VOUS POUVEZ FAIRE AUJOURD’HUI. Je vis par cette règle. Je n’aime pas laisser les choses trainer. Ça me donne du travail mais j’ai aussi plus de satisfaction. Le truc est que je réussis à accomplir plus seulement si j’intégré les taches dans mon calendrier.<br /><br />Et vous, quels conseils avez-vous pour réussir cette rentrée ?</div>',

    Content:
      '<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xCdOFOZoNk0/UlrUUFS-GGI/AAAAAAAAAzc/pEM_tiLD654/s1600/start.jpg" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-xCdOFOZoNk0/UlrUUFS-GGI/AAAAAAAAAzc/pEM_tiLD654/s1600/start.jpg" /></a></div>September to me is like January, a new year that begins. As the summer draws to an end, I look back at this year\'s goals and achievements. I also take a look at the obstacles, difficulties and what went wrong.<br /><br />So the last weeks of August, while people are sun-bathing (it doesn\'t mean I don\'t), I take time to reflect on my first 8 months of 2013. It looks like every year I have new challenges and every year I have new problems. But that is life, isn\'t it?<br /><br />I enjoy this process as it always helps me keep on track and update my personal and professional goals. I do have a lifetime, 5 year and short-terms goals list I did in a leadership program some years back. But I can see that some of my goals change as I get more experience and adapt to the 21 century latest technologies. Just on this note, I used to have \'create a magazine\' as an objective but today creating a printed magazine is almost a suicide as people read less on paper and more on their smartphones. So this goal had to be eliminated or adapted to something people can consume.<br /><br />Another beautiful thing I find about september is that I have 4 more months to readjust and revaluate my goals that I want to achieve by the end of the year. It\'s amazing how much we can do in such a short time. It is said that it takes 21 days to break an old habit or get a new one. Four months is plenty of time to be a new self, start a project, etc.<br /><br />While it\'s not enough to just reflect, I always come up with an actionable plan for each goal. I always give them deadlines. Deadlines help me put those goals on my calendar and tasks list and they become part of my life not just part of my dream list. For example, I have a goal of speaking fluent Italian. For that, I need to sign up for classes (I have tried online lessons but I think I need the real thing). The deadline to sign up would be sometime in September. Therefore, I would need to call the Italian consulate, get the information I need, sign up, pay etc. I cannot wait until October to want to join a class. It would be too late and hard to catch up on the missed classes...<br /><br />In brief, keeping track of goals can only help achieving more. At the end of the day, there is no one to judge me but my consciousness. I love giving the best I have and being the best I am.<br /><br />&lt;strong&gt;Suggested tips for you :&lt;/strong&gt;<br />1. Pull out your 2013 goals or create a new goals list for 2013<br />2. Review each goal and make an actionable plan for each objective<br />3. Don\'t forget to add dates and deadlines to each goal<br />4. Don\'t be too hard on yourself<br />5. Give the best you have and be the best you can!!<br /><br />And you, do you have any tips to share?<br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div></div>',

We all need it, don’t we? It seems like we are all on the same boat, needing encouragement, advice, tips and some reassurance.<br /><br />This blog is about how to keep being the best you are even during difficult times. It will be primarily from personal experience but I will also share any new learnings and knowledge.<br /><br />I hope you will find interesting things on this blog and that you too will be able to share with me your experience.</div>',

It\'s very likely that they are entrepreneurs who live off their passion. Whatever that is, fashion, beauty, games, cooking, it may seem as too good to be true but it’s all now possible thanks to the internet and to technology. If you too want to turn your passion into a <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/2019/04/29/how-to-build-a-business-around-your-passion-2019-inspiring-story-of-a-coach-teacher-author/">profitable business</a>, here are 7 things you need to know:\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Building a business doesn\'t just happen.</strong> You need to make time for it and plan it. It needs to be a project that you really want to make happen. Because life is full of distractions, you need to be laser-focused on the goals you want to achieve and make it part of your daily routine and habits. Building a business takes time and you may have to make the decision to change a few things in your life right now to make room for business creation and building.</li>\n \t<li><strong>A business is different from being self-employed.</strong> Be careful about your business model. If you have to sell your time, it\'s not so much a business. A real business is something that has a system and can be run with or without you being there. If the business relies entirely on you (from the design of your product/ service to the actual sale), then chances are you are just creating a job for yourself. If you want to make sure you have a real business, ask yourself: \'Is this something I could potentially sell later on?’</li>\n \t<li><strong>Successful entrepreneurs have a strong WHY bigger than just making more money.</strong> They are driven by the impact, the feedback and the stories they get from their clients. They want to serve and bring Value to their customers. Money is important too but their WHY is their biggest motivation. Successful entrepreneurs are focused on bringing the best value and service and on their customer satisfaction.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Entrepreneurship is not for everyone.</strong> There are some key characteristics. that are required to become a successful business owner. Entrepreneurship is about taking risks, being unpredictable and having no security, safety especially at the beginning. Entrepreneurship is also about being resourceful, tenacious and persistent. Do a self-check with yourself and see whether entrepreneurship is something that will work for you or not.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Entrepreneurship is not all that glamorous.</strong> Don\'t be fooled by what you see on social media. Being an entrepreneur is a lot of work. In the beginning, you have to be willing to work day in day out and spend little time scrolling your friends\' IG feeds or posing for pictures for that matter. It may be that you will be spending hours in front of your screen and on the phone without leaving the room for days. The glamour and expensive watches etc come after many years of hard work and persistence.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Building and growing a business is a marathon, not a sprint.</strong> It takes time to figure out all the right strategies, a lot of trial and errors…Success doesn\'t just happen. It\'s a long and tough journey. It takes time to build confidence, gain enough experience, get the first customers, make them super happy and be recommended to others. It\'s about not quitting when everybody else is trying to discourage you. Entrepreneurship is not for those who want to make a quick buck because it\'s a long game.</li>\n \t<li><strong>Entrepreneurship brings probably one of the most gratifying feelings ever.</strong> You create something out of nothing. It’s like giving birth. You have an amazing feeling of having contributed the world with something useful and valuable. This brings a lot of satisfaction, motivation, and desire to do more. Most people who have experienced that feeling will never go back to becoming an employee for somebody else.</li>\n</ol>\nSo, my question to you: are you ready to start a business?\n\nComment below and tell me how you are turning your passion into a business.\n\nIf you feel ready to finally make your dreams come true and turn your passion into a profitable business, then I invite you to sign up for ‘Turn Your Passion into a Profitable Business’ online course, helping each step of the way creating and building that business you’ve always wanted to launch.

    Content:
      '[caption id="attachment_1432" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="https://youtu.be/6HRfpvvf4ok"><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/RELIGION-300x169.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" class="size-medium wp-image-1432"></a> Click here to watch video[/caption]\n\nReligion is a form of personal development. Sadly, t<span style="font-weight: 400;">oo many people use religion to control nations, populations and dictate selfish and discriminatory laws and policies.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Regardless of whether we agree with what religions teach us, it is interesting to study them and understand how they have helped shape our thinking and our world.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, to me, religion is very much like personal development. In fact, it is all about personal development and growth.</span>\n\n<em><strong>If you prefer to watch the video, click <a href="https://youtu.be/6HRfpvvf4ok">here</a>.</strong></em>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This is how I see religion and personal development as one:</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Belief.</strong> Now we can say God, Lord, Universe or Higher Power but at the end of the day, it all means the same. It’s the creator of our world. In religion as well as in personal development, it is important to believe in a Higher Spirit that will execute your wishes.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Faith</strong>. In both religion and personal development, you have to have faith to succeed. You may never have met God but you believe in HIM, if you want to enter Heaven. Same goes for personal development, you have to have faith that things will get better and that you will reach your goals. Lacking faith in both of these areas would be counter-effective.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Prophets and messengers.</strong> Whether that is Mohamed, Jesus or Budha, most religions have men who act as role models to the rest of the people. In personal development, it is the same. You follow people who aspire you to become successful in business and life.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Prayer.</strong> Prayer is a religious ritual but also a form of personal development. When you pray, you speak to God in a unique way, sometimes silently, and you ask HIM for things you want in life. Whether that is good health, a house, children or a stack of cash. Prayer, to me, combines meditation and visualization in the personal development world. Meditation is that connection with the higher power, listening to the unspoken and getting deeply spiritual. And visualization is about asking what you want to receive.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Giving thanks.</strong> In Islamic cultures particularly, we say ‘hamdoullah’ thank God in every other sentence. That was something I learned way before I learned about gratitude in personal development. Being grateful and conscious of all the great things in life is essential to any human being’s balance.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Helping others.</strong> All religions stress the importance of helping others. It is what keeps us sane as a community, so we don’t kill one another. It is also a way to feed the heart and soul. In Islam, in fact, it is one of the pillars of the religion, to give annually a percentage of your wealth to the needy. Likewise, personal development stresses on being of service to others and making an impact in their lives.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Fasting.</strong> In many religions, fasting is part of the worshipper’s ritual. Today, fasting has become a trend in the world of self-help, health, and wellness. It has many benefits not only spiritually but also on the body and brain. </span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Self-control.</strong> Most religions I know promote self-control. Humans should control themselves whether that comes to eating, self-indulgence, natural biological desires, and should rather eliminate excesses. Likewise, personal development is all about attaining that balance within you (body, mind, and heart): controlling your natural pulses and staying focused on the reward.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Self-discipline.</strong> is key in religion. No one is telling you what to do but you have to motivate yourself and get things done yourself. In personal development, self-discipline is a must-have to achieve goals and attain success.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>The Promise for a reward.</strong> Both religion and personal development promise a great reward at the end of the journey: one is entering heaven hereafter and the other is experiencing success and fulfillment. These promises keep us going and give us hope that one day, it will be possible for us too!</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope this will give you a new way of looking at religions and I can’t wait to hear your thoughts. Please leave me a comment and let’s continue the discussion.</span>',

One is about submission and execution. The other is about creativity and leadership. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">However, I cannot say that one is better than the other. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Should you become an employee or an entrepreneur? I would say it all depends on the type of personality you have and above all your goals in life.

    Title: "7 Steps to Remember What You Read",
    Content:
      '[caption id="attachment_1487" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="https://youtu.be/ZiXCHij2U1A"><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/7-steps-to-remember-what-you-read-300x169.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" class="size-medium wp-image-1487" /></a> <strong>WATCH VIDEO</strong>[/caption]\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So many of us consume books, audiobooks, videos, and podcasts and do not remember much of the content that was offered. So, we end up consuming dozens of pieces of information a day without retaining any value out of them.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In this post/<a href="https://youtu.be/ZiXCHij2U1A">video</a>, I will give you tips that will help you learn better and remember what you consume:</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Know why you want to read the book:</strong> to learn about starting a business, boosting your career or for relaxation and entertainment. Be clear of the expected outcome.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Check the credentials:</strong> Before you consume any piece of information, make sure the source or the author is credible. This will help you filter junk information that may be unnecessary or unuseful.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Schedule learning in your calendar:</strong> Dedicate 15 to 30min a day learning what you need to learn. Make it a habit to learn and schedule it into your calendar</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Take notes:</strong> When you listen to a book or read an article, make sure to take notes. Writing down your ideas not only helps you remember the thoughts you’re having but also memorize what you are consuming. You can also review your notes at any time and repetition helps make the information stick.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Summarize it:</strong> Sum up your learnings in one paragraph or voice record yourself explaining your biggest takeaways. This is very important because we never take the time to check what we got out of a video, article, podcast, etc. </span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="list-style-type: none;">\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Teach it to others:</strong> Share the information you’ve learned and explain it to other people. Teaching is one of the best ways to consolidate your knowledge and reinforce your learnings. Talk to your friends about what you learned or just write a FB or IG post about it.</span></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Apply the learnings:</strong> If these are practical tips, implement them for at least a week and see for yourself. With that said, I definitely do not recommend you to read things that you may need in the far future. Always focus on reading material that will help you now or in the near future.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Learning is not about the quantity but about the quality. You need to start taking learning as a business activity and think about the ROI. Every time you consume some sort of information, it should have a return on investment for you: whether spiritually, mentally, physically or in business.</span>\n\n<a href="https://youtu.be/ZiXCHij2U1A"><strong>WATCH THE VIDEO</strong></a>\n\n<strong>QUESTION: What other tips do you have to better remember the content you consume?

      '[caption id="attachment_1494" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="https://youtu.be/yEaN-Y5vD68"><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/How-long_-300x169.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" class="wp-image-1494 size-medium"></a> WATCH VIDEO[/caption]\n\nSo we see people in social media signing books, giving TEDx talks and traveling the world and you’re wondering:\n\n“Why not me?”\n“How long is this supposed to take?”\n“When is my turn?”\n“What do THEY have that I don’t? I’m just as special!”\n\nI know you’ve been trying something for a few months (or even a few years) you’re not getting the money, recognition, fame or freedom that you want. And that can be frustrating.\n\nStop comparing yourself to the CURRENT success of other people who are your age — the Zuckerbergs and all the celebrity college dropouts.\n\nIf you want to be a success and feel you haven’t gotten there yet, here are 3 main problems:\n\n1. Laziness: it takes a lot of hard work, great discipline and thinking smart to achieve anything big in life\n2. Lack of desire: only people who want it bad enough make it happen.\n3. Lack of clarity: not knowing where you want to go etc. That is detrimental to your success\n\nSo, here is what you can do about it:\n\nSolutions\n\n<strong>1. Decide:</strong> set a strategy and decide that you will make it happen\n<strong>2. Take action:</strong> Beautiful plans are worthless without action\n<strong>3. Be patient:</strong> success doesn\'t happen overnight.\n<strong>4. When you start thinking of quitting, do not:</strong> this is where most people just drop the ball because things are getting difficult or they get overwhelming. If you quit, you will lose everything. You will most likely go back to your comfort zone where nothing great happens. So make sure to continue doing what you’re doing and get advice from more experienced people.\n<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>‘Don\'t compare your chapter 1 to someone else\'s chapter 20’</em></strong></p>\nAlso, one thing to remember is that the definition of success varies to each one of us. Some people want money and fame. Others want great relationships and being close to God. Success should be in your own terms. If you want to know more about it, check out the video I will link up here.\n\nPut in the work and believe in yourself. And remember that the most important thing right now for you is progress. Each day make it a habit to achieve one thing that will get you closer to your goals.\n\n<strong><a href="https://youtu.be/yEaN-Y5vD68">WATCH VIDEO</a></strong>\n\n&nbsp;',

A job is also a great stepping stone to becoming self-employed and an entrepreneur.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here, I am sharing with you tips that will help you land your dream job.</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Research:</strong> Before you start sending you your CV/resume and letter of motivation, make sure you do some research to identify the companies you\'d like to work for. This isn\'t about getting a job, this is about getting THE job that you\'ll love and where you\'ll be able to grow, learn and lead. So, make sure you do the necessary research. Also, make sure to use a template to help you keep track of the businesses you\'ve checked out and contacted.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Identify your value:</strong> In other words, what you will bring to the table. It\'s obvious that you want a job but what is it that you\'re offering in return? The fact that you have a Masters doesn\'t cut it. Have a clear Unique Selling Proposition that will make you stand out from the crowd.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Write an outstanding letter of motivation and resume:</strong> Yes, an outstanding application. If you send out a mediocre one, you will get mediocre results. Make sure you highlight your experience, knowledge and show your passion for what you do. Remember that your application is your only marketing material at this point. Make sure it is flawless, customized, free from typos and design issues. It needs to have that WOW factor!</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Get in touch with the big boss:</strong> Always send your application to the top leaders. Do not waste your time with the HR department which may already have tons of applications. Shoot top management and leaders. ATTENTION: This tip will only work if you have that WOW application. </span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Send your application and wait for the response:</strong> OK once you send out your customized CV and letter of motivation, wait. Do NOT stalk. Do NOT spam. Wait for a response back.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Prepare for the phone and face-to-face interview:</strong> In the meantime, prepare for the interview. Make sure you know how to introduce yourself, can show your motivation in person and have the confidence, skills, and enthusiasm you need for the job you applied for. </span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Repeat the process again (and adapt):</strong> Keep applying for more positions and send out spontaneous applications to companies until you have a satisfactory number of interview or a job offer. </span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\nRemember, searching for a job is a job itself, so dedicate enough time every day to research and outreach.\r\n\r\n<a href="https://youtu.be/ral8BUyALUo">Click here to watch video.</a>\r\n\r\nWishing you a wonderful job search and share with us what is your best job search tip that has worked for you.\r\n\r\nSpeak soon.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

    Title: "7 Habits to Supercharge Your Productivity",
    Content:
      '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://youtu.be/8630cqGLPzo"><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Supercharge-your-life-300x169.png" alt="" width="300" height="169" class="size-medium wp-image-1504 alignright" /></a>What you do on a daily basis is what determines your results. If you want to be a success and thrive, there is a set of habits to have that will enable you to be on the right path. If you don’t want much change in your life, just keep on doing what you already are. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">My daily and weekly habits keep me stay focused and help me have more or less some predictability which is somehow easier to manage. I remind myself of doing them using Google Calendar and other apps and after a while, they become second nature.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">My top habits to supercharge my productivity and life are:</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Planning.</strong> I like to plan my month, weeks and days in advance. I don’t plan each task and every hour but I have an overall theme for the quarter and month. And then I break down my goals into subgoals for my weekly and daily targets. In sum, it is about thinking strategically and not overwhelming oneself with 10-pages of goals.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Prioritizing and focusing</strong>. I don’t try to do everything. I focus on the priorities…Sometimes some areas of my life suffer because they are not a priority at that given time and my attention is fully given to my priorities. Once I prioritize, I make sure I am focused on the goal and staying away from distractions.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Dividing my time between work, family, and hobbies.</strong> It is really important for me to achieve that work-life balance everyone’s talking about. There have been times where I would be working almost 24/7 but these happen only during business launches or special work occasions. Generally, I like to have a variety of activities that help my creativity and spirit to stay high.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Keeping my phone and computer use to the minimum.</strong> Yes, I love technology but only to a certain extent. Social media and Internet browsing can be huge time wasters. So I do my best to consume information more consciously and only when the priorities have been taken care of.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Evaluating my results and actions and track my progress.</strong> What is the point of making efforts if you cannot evaluate yourself? Each week, I have a CEO Date with myself where I assess my efforts, track numbers and set the tone for the coming week. It is super important to constantly check in with yourself to make sure you are on track.</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Having a healthy lifestyle.</strong> Eating healthy and nutritious food is very important to me. I do not stand fast-food or ready-made dishes...I do consume them from time to time but on a daily basis, I privilege fresh vegetables and fruits. I also recently started running which is still not a habit yet but I can already see the benefits of it. Fueling your body and mind with the right nutrients is important to stay energized and keep your vibes to the optimum. </span></li>\r\n \t<li><strong>Bonus tips on my video</strong></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I give more explanation on my video that you can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/8630cqGLPzo">here</a>.</span>\r\n\r\n<strong>QUESTION: What are the habits that supercharge your life? </strong>',

Yet, this is probably the most crucial thing to do if you want to experience and enjoy success in your life.\r\n\r\nMost people take wonderful resolutions and start taking action. But just when things begin to get hard, they do this common thing: quit too soon. They throw in the towel saying they did everything they could to make it work and that it may not be the right decision to go with. While it may be true, for most people, it is actually just the beginning of the beginning. When things get hard, it is a sign that you are doing something right. You are going that extra mile other people are going willing to take.\r\n\r\nWhen you face roadblocks, challenges, obstacles, the thing NOT to do is to quit. This is the first filter you will have to go through and only patient and worthy people shall remain. So do NOT QUIT.\r\n\r\nAnother big mistake, I talk about in the <a href="https://youtu.be/yU5Llpp_qas">video</a>, is that most people are desiring and wanting what other people have. The problem with this is that other people\'s goals may not be yours. This is why it is so IMPORTANT to check in with yourself, connect with your inner self and chase goals your heart is truly wanting. If you are pursuing goals that belong to other people, you will not succeed because your heart is not in them.\r\n\r\nWatch the <a href="https://youtu.be/yU5Llpp_qas">video</a> for more.\r\n\r\n<strong>COMMENT DOWN BELOW AND LET ME KNOW WHAT IS THE BEGINNING THING SABOTAGING YOUR SUCCESS AT THE MOMENT</strong>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

Whether that is online courses, specialized magazines, training or coaching programs, it is one of the best investments you can ever make and the best way to spend your extra money. It will not only help you learn and deepen your skills but also help you transform pretty instantly as your learning goes on.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Tools/equipment and apps.</strong> If you have some extra cash, it is a good idea to invest in a better camera, computer or phone or even subscribe and buy apps that will help you better organize, manage your time, stay committed to special habits and tasks and systemize your life.&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Conferences and events.</strong> This is another of my favorite ways of spending your extra cash. It is about making connections, learning, growing a network of contacts and being inspired. You can\'t be successful alone. You need a team, advisors, clients, mentors...in other words, you need to meet people and make connections.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Membership groups.</strong> Along the line of networking, it is also a good idea to invest in joining a membership group where the members help one another, create projects as a group and grow together. The sense of belonging to a community bring people closer. You can offer help and receive it when needed.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Self-care.</strong> What is the point of money if you can\'t pamper yourself once in a while. Massage, spa, hammam, manicure...you name it. Do whatever makes you feel happy and alive. It is important you do something that makes you happy and not go by society\'s expectations.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Helping others.</strong> If your extra cash can help people, it is not only helpful to them but a rewarding feeling of being useful and needed in our world. I recommend scheduling this action in your calendar as a habit to do. It\'s easy to forget if no one is asking you for money that is why it\'s great to schedule it and make it a habit.</span></li>\n</ol>\nI hope this list helps.

There are a few things I like to do to prepare to achieve my goals of the year and successfully balance my personal and professional lives.\r\n\r\nBefore you get back to work and school, make sure to:\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Assess your progress.</strong> Compare your notes with your resolutions set at the beginning of the year. Have you made progress? What obstacles or challenges are you experiencing? Why? Learn from your mistakes and adjust accordingly. It is important to eliminate what needs to be eliminated ie: unrealistic goals for the last 4 months of the year. </span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>KISS.</strong> Keep it super simple. Do not overload yourself with goals and resolutions…3 goals for the last 4 months of the year are more than enough. Make sure you focus on progress rather than quantity. If you achieve one big goal, it is better than 5 small ones. </span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Focus on change of habits rather than on the goal.</strong> So many of us focus on achieving goals but to achieve goals, you need to adopt new habits or routines. So focus on successfully sticking to your new habits rather than on the final goal which may seem overwhelming and too big to achieve for now. Focus on being committed and consisted and watch your progress. This is what really matters.</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>BONUS TIP:</strong> Think of what results do you want to have by Dec 31st and reverse engineer. Think of what steps and actions you need to take in order to reach those goals. This is a way that will help you get more concrete and better visualize your goals.</span>\r\n\r\nRemember, anything is possible and you can make your dreams happen only if you are willing to do the work.\r\n\r\nHave a wonderful back-to-work/school season!\r\n\r\n<strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZ0VVmqnu7o&amp;t=214s&amp;ab_channel=SafaaNhairy">CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO</a></strong>',

    Title: "The Key to Happiness | How to be Happy Every Day",
    Content:
      "[embed]https://youtu.be/c1yREuG2dQY[/embed]\n\nIn your quest for success and achievement, you may find it hard to keep positive and be happy. Human nature seems to only focus on the negative and not consider the great things going on in life. But this video/post isn't really about positivity. I am talking here about the key to happiness and how to be happy daily no matter the challenges and obstacles you face.\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First of all, happiness has a different meaning to each one of us: a prisoner's definition of happiness may be getting out of prison, someone struggling with infertility issues may define happiness as having children and so on. The quest for happiness seems to be constant. But can we be happy now?</span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As far as I am concerned, I consider myself a happy person. I have been blessed with things I&nbsp; did nothing about. For example, I was born and brought up in a peaceful country. I had/have a loving family, I had a good childhood, I received education... There are so many events and things that contribute to my overall happiness and that I am so grateful for. With that said, I also had to make a number of decisions in my life early on, for example, the career I have chosen, my spouse, the country I currently live in, the type of business I run, etc.</span>\n\nSometimes you make decisions and you are uncertain about the outcome. It could work. It could NOT work in which case, it can cause a huge deception, tears, and sadness. But how do people who 'fail' or have tough experiences manage to continue being happy no matter what?\n\nMy sense is that they act from the heart.&nbsp; Acting from the heart makes them not have any regrets. They do things because it feels right to them at that point in time. Whether they work out or not, it doesn’t matter. What matters is that they stay true to themselves. So, happiness is that state of always being authentic, honest with yourself and acting from the heart.\n\nWhen you know what happiness is to you, you stop pursuing the wrong things and you focus on what matters the most to you. Happiness is not a selfish thing...happiness is contagious.\n\nBe happy with who you are. Be happy with what you already have. Be happy for the life you have that allows you to experience new things. Bad days can come but you will win them over if you act rightly.\n\nJust be happy!\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;",

    Title: "3 Simple Habits for Energy & Productivity",
    Content:
      "[embed]https://youtu.be/4NZOoGaQ2hM[/embed]\n\nSo, lately, I have switched a few things in my daily routine and it’s helped me be more focused, energized and productive. So today, I will be sharing with you these 3 simple habits that you can adopt into your life.\n\nTo have a successful day, you need to prepare for it the day before. This why the night before, I (and this is my tip no 1):\n<ol>\n \t<li><strong>Leave my phone and computer in a separate room.</strong> I used to always sleep with my phone on my nightstand and although I turned off the internet, there was something about having a connected device near my head that made me uncomfortable. So, thanks to Mel Robbins J I decided to leave my phone charging overnight in the kitchen. This means I cannot watch another video in my bed or be tempted to check my emails etc. I am making my room space for rest, relaxation and reading. Oh and one thing, since the phone is plugged in the kitchen, I was worried I wouldn’t hear the alarm in the morning or it would wake up the entire family when it goes off. Good thing I still hear it (no chance to hit the snooze button) and I energetically get up to turn it off so the rest of the family enjoys their sleep a little longer.</li>\n \t<li>The second thing that has dramatically helped me with my focus and productivity is <strong>waking up at least one hour before I have to.</strong> I used to be this person who would hit snooze a million times and only get up when I had to. Don’t get me wrong I am almost never late for work or my appointments. It’s just I used to get ready in a flash of an eye and that was just to enjoy one extra minute of sleep. Now, just like I said earlier, I like to prepare the success of my day the day before. So after dinner and clean-up, I like to read a bit before I go to bed and retire at around 11 pm. When I wake up at 6 am, I have one full hour or sometimes more for me. I can enjoy the silence or meditate, journal, read, stretch or even work on a project. I am not sure why it took me so long to implement this habit. I knew that all successful people start their days early but it only hit me after reading Morning Miracle by Hal Elrod. So if you need more arguments and proof that waking up is good for you, I highly recommend you read the book.</li>\n \t<li>The next habit that has made a huge impact on my mood and overall well-being is: <strong>working out</strong>. Let’s get this straight. I never liked or enjoyed working out. I always found it ridiculous to be sweaty and looking like a mad person forced onto manual labor. But there was this week where I was in bed for a few days because of bad flu. I took medication but I was still feeling tired. In fact, I had been feeling this low energy for ages. No matter how long I slept at night or if I took a nap or not, I was still feeling tired. As a mom, a wife who also runs a business and teaches at university, my tiredness may be understandable but I just couldn’t handle it anymore. I needed energy. Not supplements. Not an energy drink. Not a quick fix. So, I was faced with the fact I needed to try working out. The moment I decided to start working out, I feel I became a new person. My goal wasn’t to lose weight or to look toned. My goal was simply to move my body, that was tired of sitting in front of the computer screen all day.                                                                                                                                                                  So now, 3 times a week, I go first thing in the morning to a park and do a mix of walking, running and using machines. That is my treat of the day. And being out in nature gives an additional bonus that is so good for the mind and body. It has now become my routine and I just love it. When I don’t go out to the park, I put on a YT video and do a quick workout at home. The ultimate goal is to get moving and to improve endurance.</li>\n</ol>\nSo there you guys, these are my 3 simple habits I urge you to try for yourself. If you feel, it’s too much for you, then try one habit at a time and when you know it’s become a habit then you can move to the next one. Remember, science says that you need to do something for at least 21 days consistently before you can call it a habit.\n\nLet me know in the comments down below which of these 3 habits will you start implementing from tomorrow.\n\nCan’t wait to read your comments. See you soon!",

    Content:
      '<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">5 tips to stay focused and productive this year</span></em></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The beginning of the New Year is a good time to make resolutions. However, many of us find that what we set out for ourselves might not make it until February, not to mention August. University of Scranton research found that just 8 percent of people achieve their New Year’s goals. While setting goals can be exciting, sticking to them and working on them regularly can put people off, especially when they have to be&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">their own coaches and have no accountability or report to hand in at the end of the year.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are 5 tips to make sure you don’t repeat the same mistakes as the previous year and that you will finally achieve your most important goals:&nbsp;</span>\n<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">1. Set the right type of goals</span></em></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">First off, be honest with yourself. Are the goals you have your own or your family and friends’? You need to be 100% all-in. You have to own and believe in them. Additionally, in the world of social media comparison, it’s also easy to fall for goals you think are nice to have (because your neighbor or favorite social media influencer has done it). A nice thing to have will not cut it. A goal is not a wish. It’s a clear objective with a defined outcome.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<em><span style="font-size: 32px;">2. Write down your goals <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/leaderplanner"><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/New-Year-Goals-Social-Media-Post-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1661 alignright"></a></span></em>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A study by psychologist Gail Matthews has shown that people who write down their goals are 33% more likely to achieve them than those who don’t. Therefore, write your goals somewhere to be able to see them throughout the year. If not, how can you know you will remember them, not to mention pursue them? A good idea is to keep a notebook with you or make notes on your phone to keep track of your goals and see how you and they evolve.</span>\n<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Create a plan</span></em></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know the now-famous quote by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry: “A goal without a plan is just a wish.\'\' Therefore, don’t just stop at writing down your goals. Go a step further and make a plan on how you will achieve them. I like to break down my goals into small steps so they are more manageable and less overwhelming. Remember, the more detailed, the better.&nbsp;</span>\n<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Take time to review<a href="https://safaanhairy.com/leaderplanner"><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/LM-2-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1582 alignright"></a></span></em></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We often forget that the future is only rarely if never fully predictable. Therefore, you should set aside some hours in your schedule to go back to your plan and see how you can adjust it. I usually do that every end of the month and at the end of the quarter, I spend more time analysing my overall strategy. A lot of times, I find myself changing tactics and tweaking my strategy to achieve my goals. Change can be good and you shouldn’t be afraid to switch things around when they are not working.</span>\n<h3><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">5. Find support</span></em></h3>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Nothing is better than having someone to share your passions and hopes with. It’s a good idea to reach out to your friends, family and network to help you with achieving your goals. They could be there not only in the hardest times, but also partake in your entire journey. Yes, there is nothing more efficient than going through a diet with a best friend or your partner or learning a new language with your bestie. If you are working on starting and growing your business, a good idea is to have an accountability partner with whom you can compare notes and report to weekly.</span>\n\n<strong>To help you with setting your goals and making sure you are doing everything possible to achieve them, I created <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/leaderplanner/">Leader Planner</a>, the ultimate business and personal planner that will help turn your dreams into results.

      '<p style="text-align: right;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=maKw5-m3j4M">WATCH VIDEO</a></span></p>\n\n\n[caption id="attachment_1688" align="alignright" width="424"]<img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/habits-300x193.png" alt="Build and Sustain Good Habits" width="424" height="273" class="wp-image-1688" /> WATCH VIDEO[/caption]\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It\'s time to build good and sustainable habits. While setting goals is exciting, it takes more than just dreaming and writing your wishes to actually achieve them. Successful people do not accomplish amazing things by chance. It takes commitment and discipline to improve your results and create significant improvements in your life. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are a few tips to help you form and build good and sustainable habits.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, last year, I had as an objective to get fit and healthier. This </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">one</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">was</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> a goal of mine for many years in fact. I realized that for me to make it work, I needed to </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">make changes to my daily life meaning changing</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> change</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> my habits </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">in order for me to actually reach that goal.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> This is how I did it:</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">1. First of </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">all, </span>I <b>defined my goal more clearly. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">What means to be fit or healthy? Is it losing a specific number of kilos? Or to fit in specific clothes size? So for me, it was about feeling more energetic in my daily life and being able to run long enough without being out of breath: 30min.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So the first thing you need to do is be as specific as possible and quantify your goal. You want to make more money. Then how much more money and by when? You want to read more books? How many a month? </span>\n\n<b>2. Think strategically.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> What </span><b>daily action</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> you can take that will make a significant change in your life? For example, if you want to start waking up at 5 am every day, a significant step for you would be to go to bed early - 10 pm or so. For me, to be able to run consistently and feel energized, I needed to run 3 times a week. Once or twice a week is not enough. So 3 times is what would bring me the results I am looking for.</span>\n\n<b>3. Create the right environment.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> While you’re forming a new habit, you need to be supported While we cannot always ensure that we’re surrounded by the right people, it’s good to be in an environment that will inspire us to stick to our new habits long enough until they become natural habits. For example, if you want to quit smoking, then you might have to stop hanging out with that smoker friends, at least until you successfully form your habit. If you want to drink less sodas, then start by banning yourself from bringing any soft drinks at home. +use technology (reminders, alarms etc)</span>\n\n<b>4. Schedule it.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If it’s not on your calendar then it’s not gonna happen. For me, I made sure I scheduled my runs every other day first thing in the morning. It was the only way for me to ensure I was actually going to do my workout. On days where I delayed my workout because of work, I didn’t actually exercise at all. One hint from my mom was to upon waking up, putting sports gear on so you don’t have to debate with yourself whether or not you should work out on that day. So put it in your calendar and set specific days for your new habits to happen.</span>\n\n<b>5. Associate your new habit with something that you already do naturally.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> For example, when you go to bed each night, you will read at least 5 pages. That way you will develop the habit of reading. Going to bed will be associated with reading. For me, I developed the habit of dropping off my kids to school and then going for a run. Make sure to associate your new habit with an existing one.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Remember that less is more. Start with one habit at a time. Make sure you are committed and that you’re enjoying the small improvements. If you want a healthy and fit body. It won’t happen overnight. If you want to become a superstar, it won’t happen overnight. If you want to become a millionaire, it takes a lot of work, commitment and discipline. Your daily habits reflect the path you’re on.</span>\n\n<strong>Let me know what habit you want to build in 2020 and what will you associate with? Comment below! </strong>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, don’t forget you can find me on other social media channels: LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s all grow in 2020 and make each moment of our life another step towards our better selves!</span>',

Here are 10 habits to build and watch yourself improve and grow. </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Learning a new skill. </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should always be top of your list. Spare a few minutes per day to learn a new skill or language. I love to use my lunchtime to spend 15min on Duolingo studying and practising Italian. Whatever skill you want to learn and master, schedule it in your calendar.</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Searching for <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/2020/06/03/17-business-ideas-to-launch-during-the-coronavirus-crisis/">opportunities</a></b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Dedicating a specific amount of time per week for searching for new opportunities. Whether that is prospecting clients or finding a new job or checking out the real estate market, dedicate the habit to look out for opportunities.</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Limiting your social media consumption</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Let’s be honest, it is a complete waste of time. You could use that time to build an empire or learn new concrete things.</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Spending more time networking in real life</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Leave your phone and computer and start mingling and having meaningful conversations with people. Connect with them on a deeper level. Go to events, attend workshops...Start connecting in real life.</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Reading</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Reading helps open your mind up to the world and learn so much from experts. Reading can also be a way to relax and unwind.</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Working out</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. I don’t need to tell you about the benefits of sports but the more you work out the better your body gets and the happier and smarter you’ll be. So start now!</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Eat healthier and more</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> …. Less refined sugars and processed food. More </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">natural and alive </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">food. Not only it’s good for your body but for your mood too. Cravings will also decrease.</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Limiting impulse purchases</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Buying stuff increase clutter. You want to not only be mindful for the waste you create but also to have less stuff to worry about at home. Remember the more stuff you have, the more space you need and the more you need to take care of them (cleaning, storing etc) Try the one item in, one item out strategy.</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Self-assessing yourself</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. At the end of each week, month and quarter, make sure you take a few minutes to review your actions and the results. Adapt and change strategies as appropriate.</span></li>\n<li style="font-weight: 400; text-align: left;"><b>Taking care of yourself.</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do whatever makes you feel good that isn’t harmful. Go to the sauna, hammam, go out to nature, have a walk, spend some time alone, start painting or playing the piano.

Also, don’t forget you can find me on other social media channels: LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram. </strong></p>\n<p>To buy school essays UK is simple, but you must know what type of essays to buy and how to choose the right one. Remember that there are two varieties of essays, and these can be selected the basis of one\'s present circumstance or personality.Primarily, there will be the generic essays. These are written for practically any essay of almost any subject, but they are usually written in English and also have a very large wordcount. A generic essay will not give you a good idea regarding the kind of <a href="https://www.affordable-papers.net/">affordable papers</a> that you would have to create, nor does one really have an idea regarding whether it would be handy to learn.</p>\n<p>Second, there are people which are written with proper writing abilities. All these are simple to learn, and also the writer has had all of the required measures to make sure it is a piece of work that doesn\'t take very long to complete. Moreover, this can be a difficult form of essay, since the writer may try to become as clear as possible, however the amount of information he or she takes is likely to make it difficult for one to grasp.But there are the ones which are written on the Internet, and these are able to be written in English or a different terminology, but the writer still attempts to make sure it is clear.</p>\n<p>That is generally a fantastic alternative, because it\'s going to make the essay easier to read and understand, and also at precisely the same time may help the reader comprehend that the message.Once you\'ve the right type of essay in mind, you are able to begin to consider what type of material you will need to purchase to write it. It is required to make certain you purchase the sort of essay that you\'re in need of. You may want to start with figuring out what subject must give the reader the desired effect.By way of example, if the niche is one of the sciences, such as physics, then you may need to buy a chemistry essay. If the situation that you are dealing with is just one of writing, then perhaps you need to buy a medical essay.</p>\n<p>No matter what the niche, your composition needs to support the ingredients that you need to allow it to be an effective bit of work.You must have a plan of attack, so make sure that you are able to get the materials to create the essays in order. There are a number of stores on the web where you should purchase different types of essays, and also you need to compare prices. When you do so you will see there are lots of unique choices available and you\'re going to be able to generate a smart choice.</p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let’s all grow in 2020 and make each moment of our life another step towards our better selves!</span></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

    Title: "WHAT TO DO DURING THE CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN",
    Content:
      '<img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Canva-Person-Holding-Pen-Writing-on-White-Paper-300x149.jpg" alt="To Do During Coronavirus Lockdown" class="alignnone wp-image-1707" width="439" height="218" />\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So you’ve been complaining for years about not having the time and being stressful. Your head and body are always moving from one direction to another. Now with the current crisis situation, you may be able to work remotely (if your job allows it) or to continue to do so (if you are used to doing it). With that said, even if you work from home, you will find yourself having a lot of free time on your hands. There is nowhere you can go to and plenty of time to make use of. Here is a list of ideas of what to do during the Coronavirus lockdown.</span>\n\n<b>WORK-RELATED PROJECTS</b>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Deliver the work you were hired for: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">This applies to employees as well as entrepreneurs. Obviously, if you can work from home then you can still deliver your work, especially for service-based businesses.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Re-think your branding: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Is your website up-to-date? Are you happy with your logo and graphic design? How about your Linkedin profile? Review your descriptions, bios, etc.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Prepare a plan: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">None knows how long we will be confined for. You need to start thinking about your plan B to account for things not going back to normal in the coming weeks. How will you make sure you continue making money? Can you create new offers? Etc</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Connect with your current clients and audience: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Make use of this downtime to get <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/2018/02/03/how-to-network-effectively-create-meaningful-connections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">connected</a> to your clients and online audience, be closer to them, listen to their needs and be there for them.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Look for new opportunities: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">They may or may not be within your industry. Be open-minded and foreseeing. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<b>HOUSE-RELATED PROJECTS</b>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>House deep clean:  </b>This may be one of the first things to do during the Coronavirus lockdown. <span style="font-weight: 400;">Your kitchen cupboards and closets need a good Spring clean. This is the perfect time to do so.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Declutter:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Go through your old stuff and rearrange. Clean, tidy-up and donate where necessary. Your computer, new and old phones may also need a good digital tidying-up.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>House projects:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Maybe you can finally fix that shelf or that broken cupboard door. If you are not talented enough to do it yourself, you may want to rearrange your house, switch things around and see how you feel about them. Change can be good.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Give love to those plants:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You may neglect them as I always do. So this is the time to show them some love with regular care.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Cook new recipes:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> If you’re one that eats out a lot, well this is going to be a great change for you. Eating at home doesn’t have to be boring. Try new recipes and start discovering new talents of yours.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<b>WELL-BEING </b>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Move your body: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise daily if you can. There are millions of videos online. Try new workouts you can do from home. I love Tabata workout and <a href="https://bohobeautiful.life/?v=11aedd0e4327" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Boho Beautiful’s</a> yoga videos. You don’t need much space to have a good sweat.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Meditate:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You now have time to learn to meditate. It can be off-putting at first because it requires discipline and commitment before you can start seeing the results. Take your time to learn this very beneficial habit.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Connect with your inner self:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Away from all distractions, social outings and work obligations, who are you? Connect with yourself in a way you never have before. I recommend the book A New Earth by Eckart Tolle for more on this.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Pamper yourself:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Finally, you can take longer showers and treat yourself to a home foot massage. Give thanks to those feet carrying your body and taking you places. Ladies will have much to do from home facials to manicures and spas. So many possibilities.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Relax &amp; Rest: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Enjoy the quiet. No need to fill the silence with music or videos, just be. You may also want to sleep longer hours and nap. Time to get recharged.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<b>LEARNING</b>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Learn a new language:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Do it from the comfort of your home. I love Duolinguo. It’s efficient for me to make progress every day. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Learn a new skill:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Whether that is graphic design, trading or video-making, this is the time to get disciplined to learn something new and master it.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Read: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You’ve been buying books and piling them up. Now you can make it a habit to read every single day.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Practice: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time to practice skills you’ve learned months or years ago. If you’ve taken sushi classes before, time to make sushi. If you’ve taken Web Design courses before, time to create a website.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Game: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can also learn through gaming and playing board games. Great opportunity to dust them off.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<b>FUN</b>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Organize a theme night:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> You may be stuck with your siblings or kids for the rest of the lockdown but it doesn’t have to be a chore, make it fun. Organize a themed night: disco, pirates, movie night… Make food, play music and have an overall feel of your theme. Be creative!</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Watch movies &amp; shows: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time to catch up on your favorite shows and movies. But it’s also an opportunity to watch programs you don’t usually do. How about documentaries, biographies and classic movies?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Play games:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Online or offline. Whether you are alone or not, sometimes you only need just simple things like a pen and paper. Who remembers the Jeu du Baccalaureat (</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Scattegories)</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">? There are so many possibilities and the options are endless.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Start singing:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> I just ordered a karaoke microphone and I think we will make a lot of use of it during this phase. Singing is good for the mood and is a lot of fun. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Practice your hobbies: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Playing music, taking photos, cooking, gardening, drawing, painting, writing etc. If you don’t know or remember what your hobbies are, what did you use to enjoy when you were a child? Re-ignite those passions of yours.</span></li>\n \t<li>Know your strengths and weakness. O Must be coordinated - a massive portion of writing essays to the money is organization is a must. If You\'re a Kind of individual who needs help writing your essays for money with professional <a href="https://papertyper.net/">paper typer</a> service, attempt the following guidelines:O Don\'t be worried if it\'s difficult - there isn\'t any such thing as a simple means to be successful in any small business. Always remember that some things are hopeless to be achieved without any sort of assistance.</li>\n</ol>\n<b>SOCIAL LIFE</b>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Video call, text, email your loved ones: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your friends and family are alone. You may not be with one another physically during these difficult times but you can still be there for them by chatting with them.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Call old friends:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Time to re-connect and cherish those old friends of yours that have made your childhood and youth years more agreeable. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Connect with your neighbors:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Depending on where you are, you may be able to visit neighbors in your building and have a bit of social life together. Cornovirus lockdown shouldn\'t prevent you from having social contact, given you all respect the distancing.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Organize a party online: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Invite friends and family to an online party. Make your food at home, dress up and get all connected online at the same time. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Play games, cook together etc: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">You can bond even further and do activities remotely such as playing games and cooking, with your loves ones. You don’t have to cut off all relationships. Maintain them and be creative of how you do activities together online. </span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">These may be difficult times to go through but we have to be </span><b>grateful</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">, grateful for being alive and healthy, grateful for having food in our fridges, grateful for having this quiet time to connect with ourselves and rest.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Also, many of us take it for granted but the fact that we have an internet connection and computers/phones to stay in touch with our loved ones and the world is a huge thing. It will definitely help us with our mental health.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, I urge you to pay attention to your consumption of the news. You may have to stay informed about the COVID-19 but just do not overwhelm yourself with information that may not advance your life right now. Focus your energy on great things that will make you feel good and whole. Anxiety and worrying never helped anyone.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me know </span><b>what other ideas you have to add to the list above</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">  of things to do during the quarantine and stay in touch.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Have a wonderful, productive and restful time!</span>',

    Title: "Goal-Setting and Planning for September",
    Content:
      '<img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Photo-September-article-1-300x251.png" alt="September planning" class="wp-image-1714 aligncenter" width="300" height="251" /><span></span>\n\n<span>An</span><span>x</span><span>iously looki</span><span>ng at ho</span><span>w many vacation days you have left? </span><span>Dreading the perspective of going back to school/work? I’m here for you. </span>\n\n<span>Even though time is an illusion (read </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Now-Guide-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808"><span>‘The power of now</span></a><span>’), decide to specifically make these last months of the year awesome. Take advantage of this moment to see where you are with your plan!</span>\n\n<span>So many of us rush into going back to their working/student life, but what I urge you to do right now is to take a step back and search for more clarity. How? Here are 4 steps to boost your journey in this new beginning. </span>\n\n<span>1. Keep in mind your mission</span>\n\n<span>We all know the question. What makes you wake up everyday? When I asked my son this question, he said ‘well, because I don’t want to sleep anymore’. It is the perfect answer for his age, but you should come up with a better one.</span>\n\n<span>It is beyond your degree, job, house, car or other possessions. It is much more important, it is your plan on impacting the world in a positive and lasting way. For instance, I still talk about how great my grandparents were, because they passed on to me values that I will cherish forever. </span>\n\n<span>You know when you will get this right, because you will feel excited about the next day and you will enjoy each one of them. </span>\n\n<span>2. Reassess your goals</span>\n\n<span>Take a look at last week’s </span><a href="https://tinyurl.com/qt3kjtw"><span>video</span></a><span>, as I analyzed this subject in more detail. What you should know is that this period is perfect to see where you are with your plan on achieving your goals.</span>\n\n<span>Know what you have done, where you are and what is still needed. You can actually redesign your journey. And please, do not be too harsh on yourself, this is never productive. For example, I set a goal at the beginning of this year to get trained in a specific field. I had to postpone this goal, as my planning is already full until the end of the year. So change if you need to. </span>\n\n<span>3. Keep it simple</span>\n\n<span>Keep the process simple, do not make it too complicated. What do I mean by that?</span>\n\n<span>As you know, if you follow me on </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/safaanhairy/"><span>Instagram</span></a><span>, in June I started working out regularly, no excuses allowed. Recently, I started another habit, the miracle morning - a routine that involves meditation, visualization, positive affirmation etc. </span>\n\n<span>So I added another habit only after the older one settled in. Baby steps are essential and being patient with your own development is what you need. Work on your habits as they determine your success. </span>\n\n<span>So what is your priority in the next four months? Focus only on that.</span>\n\n<span>4. Consistency is everything</span>\n\n<span>It goes without saying. It’s about consistency. </span>\n\n<span>Imagine I worked out only twice per week, then stop and start after some days. Would I achieve anything? Would I still have this habit? No.</span>\n\n<span>When you get the chance, look at how children approach anything they do. My son learns to ride his bike. He has a lot of fails at the beginning, but keeps trying until he succeeds. We were all like this at one point, we can still find within us the resources to push ourselves.</span>',

    Title: "Books &amp; Podcasts I love right now",
    Content:
      '<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline"><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Photo-Books-Articles-300x251.png" alt="favourite books presentation" class="size-medium wp-image-1720 aligncenter" width="300" height="251"></span></strong>\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Books</strong></span>\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.amazon.fr/Miracle-Morning-Hal-ELROD/dp/275408472X"><i>Morning Miracle</i></a></span>\n\n<span>Waking up early is good for you. You knew this, right? I did. However, I remember how crazy it seemed to me that Oprah wakes up at 4 am.</span>\n\n<span>I needed to read this book to fully commit to that. And I don’t regret it, it is a gamechanger. I even talked about it in my last <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NZOoGaQ2hM&amp;t=72s">video</a>.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>My friend did not have any problem waking up, but never considered it as he did not know what to do so early in the morning. For my friend, this book was a great lesson, as it teaches you exactly what to do:&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>Silence - meditate</span>\n\n<span>Affirmation - tell yourself positive sentences</span>\n\n<span>Visualization - see your future self as being what you want</span>\n\n<span>Exercise - give yourself and your body time to move</span>\n\n<span>Reading - something that will uplift, inspire, help grow</span>\n\n<span>Scrubbing - or writing. Get rid of your worries or write about your goals.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Building-StoryBrand-Clarify-Message-Customers-ebook/dp/B06XFJ2JGR"><i>Building a Story Brand</i></a></span>\n\n<span>If you’re looking to market your product or to position yourself as a working person in the employment market, definitely read this one. Don’t worry, it is not a classic sales book. It rather teaches you to structure your thoughts around positioning.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>You can get that good, that you will see how all companies, advertisers, movie makers, everyone is following the same script. That is because you often buy something because you love the story. So this book teaches you all the basics to take into consideration when creating this story.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>So try this book if you want people to come to you because they love your story or the story of your brand, rather than because you pushed your product.</span>\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Love-Languages-Secret-that-Lasts/dp/080241270X"><i>5 Love</i><i> La</i><i>nguages</i></a></span>\n\n<span>I think this book is about all your loved ones, even though it concentrates more on the marital relationships. So people like your spouse, mother, father, friends, sister, brother etc.</span>\n\n<span>So how did you feel when you received a very lousy present on your birthday from one of these people, given that you worked so hard for theirs? Angry? Frustrated? Like they don’t get you? I get you. But what dr. … teaches us that the problem resides in the fact that you have a different love language.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>So after understanding what the book is telling us, you will be able to see how others have different love languages or even dialects. So you won’t try to force your way on others, but rather appreciate their way of saying ‘I love you’. Like this, you will see how what is important for you, is not the same for others.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>What are the ways people declare their love? Dr … has split them into these 5 categories:&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span>&nbsp;Words of affirmation</span></li>\n \t<li><span>Acts of service</span></li>\n \t<li><span>Receiving gifts</span></li>\n \t<li><span>Quality time</span></li>\n \t<li><span>Physical touch</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span>Let me know your top love language in the comments!</span>\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline"><strong>Podcasts</strong></span>\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline"><i><a href="https://www.ikonns.com/podcast">The Ikonns</a></i></span><b><i>\n</i></b>\n\n<span>I’ve been following Alex and Mimi for some time now. I love to see their journey, from when they started the company, their success as business owners and then how they sold it recently.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>What is inspiring about their story is how they are both immigrants in Canada who started from scratch and became extremely successful.</span>\n\n<span>Why their podcasts you may ask? Because they really go deep in their discussions with their guests. It’s like I’m there, asking them all the questions that come in my mind.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>So if you’re like me, searching for inspiration while analyzing some topics in a more deep manner, check out this one!</span>\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://www.akimbo.link/#all-the-ways-to-listen"><i>Akimbo</i></a></span>\n\n<span>As you know, Seth Godin is a marketing expert, as well as a recognized author.&nbsp; </span>\n\n<span>Why this podcast? Because it is eye-opening. I don’t know about you, but I never thought about a fridge that would communicate with the supermarkets and food providers to let them know exactly what you need to eliminate waste. I know, right?</span>\n\n<span>Seth talks a lot about cultural issues and how they make us market products differently, how it impacts the way we do business and how in general everything is interconnected. So quality information, guys.</span>\n\n<span>And if you’re still not convinced, know that it is much shorter than other podcasts, so perfect for commuting, cooking or working out.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="text-decoration: underline"><a href="https://tim.blog/podcast/"><i>The Tim Ferris Show</i></a></span>\n\n<span>If Akimbo is perfect when you’re in a hurry, this podcast is the opposite. Some of these podcasts last 2 hours. So you’ll need some time and attention.</span>\n\n<span>As you know, Tim Ferris hangs out with the world’s champions in a certain field: sportsmen, artists, businessmen etc.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>Why this podcast? Because there are so many takeaways from listening to all these successful people and how they managed to get where they are. And you don’t necessarily have any other occasion to listen to them, as they are not what you would call famous. Just successful.</span>\n\n<span>Hope you will check out all these books and podcasts!</span>\n\n<span>But remember, you should take a pause from consuming information so that you have time to digest and apply this knowledge to your life.&nbsp;</span>',

    Content:
      '<span><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Photo-Mistakes-article-300x187.png" alt="entrepreneur mistakes presentation" class="size-medium wp-image-1728 aligncenter" width="300" height="187" /></span>\n\n<span>I made a lot of mistakes in my life, and many more in my entrepreneurial life. As most of you want and will open your own business, let me help you with what I’ve learned from my journey started years ago.</span>\n\n<b><i>Having too much overheads</i></b>\n\n<span>Insurance, rent, too much staff,phone plans to pay. A lot of payments to be done for a start-up. So set up with what</span>\n\n<span> you have, particularly if you don’t have a lot of market visibility.. See if it is profitable, then you can invest more. Preferably other people’s money. </span>\n\n<b><i>Not studying the market</i></b>\n\n<span>Now I know better. You should too, as this is a huge mistake. Make sure your product is wanted, that your audience needs your creation. How? Check the market gap by surveys, focus groups or even directly asking your potential customer. </span>\n\n<b><i>Not focusing enough on my client</i></b>\n\n<span>I wanted my product to be </span><span>perfect. As the quality is essential, however, you should always have your customer in mind and communicating efficiently to them is how your business will survive. Own your niche, own your community by clearly understanding them. Get specific.</span>\n\n<b><i>Depending on others to sell</i></b>\n\n<span>Your sales team should be great at selling what you do. But if they leave the company, it’s your responsibility to do it and prepare others to follow you. Be the number one salesperson of your company. How? Go out there, prac</span><span>tice your pitch, see people\'s reactions and optimize.</span>\n\n<b><i>Not knowing my client</i></b>\n\n<span>Trying to satisfy everyone means not satisfying perfectly the ones who matter. Think about your ideal client and go find them. It is ok to not work with everyone, so that you save yourself time and energy. You think you are specific enough? Get deeper, I’m sure you can. </span>\n\n<b><i>Giving up too soon</i></b>\n\n<span>Launching a business and working on it for a year was great, but when it did not end where I planned, I gave up. Now I am finally in a position to say that one year is not enough. Try changing your strategy, invest more and in other areas. Find a way to make it work, because there is always a way to do that.</span>\n\n<span> </span>\n\n<span>For me, I needed to make those mistakes to learn what I did, to meet the people I met and build the network I have now. I hope this helped you to avoid some of my mistakes.</span>\n\n<span>Let me know in the comments below what mistakes you made in your journey up until now and what it taught you. </span>',

      '<img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Photo-Books-Goals-2020-article-300x167.png" alt="Goals end of the year" class="size-medium wp-image-1733 aligncenter" width="300" height="167">\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span>Here are some tips that will help you stick to your goals and actually achieve t</span><span>hem by the end of 2020</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span>1. Focus</span>\n\n<span>On your goals and projects. With your list, remind yourself every single day about them. This is why is important to have </span><span>reminders in the form of a vision board, mood board or even just sticky notes close to you.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span>2. Set a routine and plan your days in advance</span>\n\n<span>Start in the morning with what gives you energy to keep going through the day. It could be working out, meditation, drinking lemon juice etc. Don’t limit on what all youtubers are telling you to do. Get personal and see what works for you. Make it a ritual.</span>\n\n<span>In the evening, it’s time to work on your self-discovery. Yes, chasing money might sound great, but life, as you know, is abo</span><span>ut getting to know yourself. So write your breakthroughs, reflect, plan your next days, think of new ideas. Make this a ritual as well.</span>\n\n<span>Finally, once a week, have a overview of your next 7 days. Like that, you can have an idea of what will happen next.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span>3. Be consistent</span>\n\n<span>Imagine having as a go</span><span>al a</span><span>t the beginning of the year to get fit. Do you think it would be enough to work out once or twice to achieve it? Of course not, it takes a lot more time. This applies to all your goals, personal or professional.</span>\n\n<span>A lot of people don’t succeed not because they are not smart, talented or have luck, but because they give up too soon. Be disciplined and commit to achieve your dreams. And don’t be afraid to change strategies.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span>Hope this helped!

      '<img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Photo-Girl-boss-article-300x190.png" alt="woman entrepreneur advice" class="size-medium wp-image-1749 aligncenter" width="300" height="190">\n\n<span>As requested by my girl readers, I’m going to give you some tips on how to succeed in your business, career and personal life.</span>\n\n<span>As you know, I am everything you can imagine: an entrepreneur, a University lecturer, a wife, a mom, a sister, etc. And I get involved personally in everything. So girl, let me help you with some tips on how to manage all these roles successfully.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b><i>Have a vision</i></b>\n\n<span>What is your ideal life? You may work 9 to 5, be exhausted and have no energy to spend with your children. If this is what you want, that is ok. If not, you should clearly understand that.</span>\n\n<span>Ask yourself first what you want, then pass on to the other tips.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b><i>Prioritize</i></b>\n\n<span>This applies to everything in life. If your job is your priority, you have to accept that something else will suffer, like eating less healthy, having less time to spend with your spouse, etc. With every choice, there is a sacrifice.\n</span>\n\n<span>For me, my choice has always been time and freedom over money. Don’t get me wrong, I love making money, but I value my time more.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b><i>Delegate</i></b>\n\n<span>If you’re a control freak like me, you may find this rather difficult. But you need to do it if you want a balanced life.\n</span>\n\n<span>Try starting with food, cleaning your house, babysitting your child for a couple of hours, etc. See what works for you and start delegating.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b><i>Relax a bit</i></b>\n\n<span>We, as women, mothers and professionals, want to control everything, which is not possible. You do what you have to do, and then take a step back and let things develop as you planned.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span>I hope you find these useful. Let me know in the comments your own tips for succeeding as a busy mom or professional woman.&nbsp;</span>',

    Title: "Soft Skills You Need to Succeed",
    Content:
      '<img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Photo-Soft-skillz-article-300x189.png" alt="soft skills presentation" class="size-medium wp-image-1754 aligncenter" width="300" height="189">\n\n<span>Hello everyone! Let me address some of your questions regarding the soft skills we all need.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b><i>What set of skills to develop more in order to succeed fast?</i></b>\n\n<span>A lot of great communicators have more chances compared to others to develop as successful professionals. This is because they are able to sell, attract investment, negotiate better. So communication skills are essential in my opinion.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>If developed correctly and intensely, you can understand the human mind and actually predict customer behavior, which is a one of a kind trait.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b><i>How to make customers trust your brand?</i></b>\n\n<span>The customer today can choose from so many options so you can convince them by offering them more than the others. This means your product has to be an incredible one, not seen in the market.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>If you don’t have that, you may ask? Then your customer service quality comes into play. The quality is given by your perspective concerning your clients. Rather than seeing them as a money-making machine, see them as a long lasting relationship. This is why thinking that in the first year you will sell a lot of products, you are living in a dream, as the trust takes time to build.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>Think about and improve the following:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span>Be there when and how they need or want</span></li>\n \t<li><span>What is your unique selling proposition, how are you going to help them in a way others won’t?</span></li>\n</ul>\n&nbsp;\n\n<b><i>How to sell in an interview?</i></b>\n\n<span>I have 3 tips on that:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span>Prepare for every single interview</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span>When you are pitching, you should always prepare. For every single one. Because they are all different as the person in front of you will be extremely different. Tailor your approach according to the problems and needs that the other part has.&nbsp;</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span>Give it all your best</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span>Don’t be too shy, don’t ever think you are giving too much. Even if the opportunity might not become a success, I assure you will at one point get the return on your investment. Be generous.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li><span>Be authentic</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span>Don’t try to copy someone else. You can have your own style and your own way of pitching. How? By practicing and therefore becoming more comfortable.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b><i>How important is it to be honest with your potential client?</i></b>\n\n<span>Essential. I would even go further to say that you should also be authentic, sincere with yourself. It has to come from the heart.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>How do I know? In many job interviews I attended, the conclusion often was ‘I don’t </span><i><span>feel</span></i><span> that this person is right’. So many times feelings play a huge part in your interactions. This is why being authentic ensures a good connection with the other part of the discussion.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b><i>How to boost your emotional intelligence?</i></b>\n\n<span>First, you should read on this subject, as this is essential to understand how you and the others around are functioning emotionally.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>Secondly, meditation is considered by a great deal of people as an efficient way to improve this type of intelligence. You may think you are wasting 20 minutes of your life, but the reality is that you gain a better mental health. Just quiet your mind and let it be, in this ever-busy life.</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<b><i>What do you think about the law of attraction?</i></b>\n\n<span>I think only good things. I have to say I used to imagine many scenarios when I was young that actually come to life. Only in recent years did I realise that I really lived certain moments before in my brain.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span>So just try this exercise: think about something you really want in your life, imagine how it happens, feel it in your mind and body and then let go. This letting go is essential so that you don’t become frustrated. Don’t be obsessed, don’t try to control it. Let go and the universe will do it for you.&nbsp;</span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span>Hope my answers helped! Let me know in the comments below how you develop soft skills!</span>',

    Title: "Goal-Setting and Planning for September",
    Content:
      '<span style="font-weight: 400;">Anxiously looking at how many vacation days you have left? Dreading the perspective of going back to school/work? I’m here for you. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Even though time is an illusion (read </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Now-Guide-Spiritual-Enlightenment/dp/1577314808"><span style="font-weight: 400;">‘The power of now</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">’), decide to specifically make these last months of the year awesome. Take advantage of this moment to see where you are with your plan!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So many of us rush into going back to their working/student life, but what I urge you to do right now is to take a step back and search for more clarity. How? Here are 4 steps to boost your journey in this new beginning. </span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep in mind your mission</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We all know the question. What makes you wake up every day? When I asked my son this question, he said ‘well, because I don’t want to sleep anymore’. It is the perfect answer for his age, but you should come up with a better one.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It is beyond your degree, job, house, car or other possessions. It is much more important, it is your plan for impacting the world in a positive and lasting way. For instance, I still talk about how great my grandparents were because they passed on to me values that I will cherish forever. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You know when you will get this right because you will feel excited about the next day and you will enjoy each one of them. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Reassess on your goals</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Take a look at last week’s </span><a href="https://tinyurl.com/qt3kjtw"><span style="font-weight: 400;">video</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, as I analysed this subject in more detail. What you should know is that this period is perfect to see where you are with your plan for achieving your goals.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Know what you have done, where you are and what is still needed. You can actually redesign your journey. And please, do not be too harsh on yourself, this is never productive. For example, I set a goal at the beginning of this year to get trained in a specific field. I had to postpone this goal, as my planning is already full until the end of the year. So change if you need to. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Keep it simple</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Keep the process simple, do not make it too complicated. What do I mean by that?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, if you follow me on </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/safaanhairy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Instagram</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, in June I started working out regularly, no excuses allowed. Recently, I started another habit, the miracle morning - a routine that involves meditation, visualization, positive affirmation etc. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So I added another habit only after the older one settled in. Baby steps are essential and being patient with your own development is what you need. Work on your habits as they determine your success. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So what is your priority in the next four months? Focus only on that.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">4. Consistency is everything</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It goes without saying. It’s about consistency. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine I worked out only twice per week, then stop and start after some days. Would I achieve anything? Would I still have this habit? No.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you get the chance, look at how children approach anything they do. My son learns to ride his bike. He has a lot of fails at the beginning but keeps trying until he succeeds. We were all like this at one point, we can still find within us the resources to push ourselves.</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;',

    Title: "Books & Podcasts I love right now",
    Content:
      '<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Books</span></em>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Morning Miracle</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Waking up early is good for you. You knew this, right? I did. However, I remember how crazy it seemed to me that Oprah wakes up at 4 am.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I needed to read this book to fully commit to that. And I don’t regret it, it is a gamechanger. I even talked about it in my last video (link). </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">My friend did not have any problem waking up but never considered it as he did not know what to do so early in the morning. For my friend, this book was a great lesson, as it teaches you exactly what to do: </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Silence - meditate</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Affirmation - tell yourself positive sentences</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Visualisation - see your future self as being what you want</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Exercise - give yourself and your body time to move</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Reading - something that will uplift, inspire, help grow</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Scrubbing - or writing. Get rid of your worries or write about your goals. </span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Building a Story Brand</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re looking to market your product or to position yourself as a working person in the employment market, definitely read this one. Don’t worry, it is not a classic sales book. It rather teaches you to structure your thoughts around positioning. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">You can get that good, that you will see how all companies, advertisers, movie makers, everyone is following the same script. That is because you often buy something because you love the story. So this book teaches you all the basics to take into consideration when creating this story. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So try this book if you want people to come to you because they love your story or the story of your brand, rather than because you pushed your product.</span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>5 Love Languages</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think this book is about all your loved ones, even though it concentrates more on the marital relationships. So people like your spouse, mother, father, friends, sister, brother etc.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So how did you feel when you received a very lousy present on your birthday from one of these people, given that you worked so hard for theirs? Angry? Frustrated? Like they don’t get you? I get you. But what dr. … teaches us that the problem resides in the fact that you have a different love language. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So after understanding what the book is telling us, you will be able to see how others have different love languages or even dialects. So you won’t try to force your way on others, but rather appreciate their way of saying ‘I love you’. Like this, you will see how what is important for you, is not the same for others. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">What are the ways people declare their love? Dr … has split them into these 5 categories: </span>\r\n<ul>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Words of affirmation</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Acts of service</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Receiving gifts</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Quality time</span></li>\r\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Physical touch</span></li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me know your top love language in the comments!</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Podcasts</span></em>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Ikonns</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I’ve been following Alex and Mimi for some time now. I love to see their journey, from when they started the company, their success as business owners and then how they sold it recently. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is inspiring about their story is how they are both immigrants in Canada who started from scratch and became extremely successful.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why their podcasts you may ask? Because they really go deep in their discussions with their guests. It’s like I’m there, asking them all the questions that come in my mind. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So if you’re like me, searching for inspiration while analysing some topics in a more deep manner, check out this one!</span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b><i>Akimbo</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, Seth Godin is a marketing expert, as well as an author. Famous books are …. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why this podcast? Because it is eye-opening. I don’t know about you, but I never thought about a fridge that would communicate with the supermarkets and food providers to let them know exactly what you need to eliminate waste. I know, right?</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Seth talks a lot about cultural issues and how they make us market products differently, how it impacts the way we do business and how in general everything is interconnected. So quality information, guys.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">And if you’re still not convinced, know that it is much shorter than other podcasts, so perfect for commuting, cooking or working out. </span>\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n<b><i>The Tim Ferris Show</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If Akimbo is perfect when you’re in a hurry, this podcast is the opposite. Some of these podcasts last 2 hours. So you’ll need some time and attention.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, Tim Ferris hangs out with the world’s champions in a certain field: sportsmen, artists, businessmen etc. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Why this podcast? Because there are so many takeaways from listening to all these successful people and how they managed to get where they are. And you don’t necessarily have any other occasion to listen to them, as they are not what you would call famous. Just successful.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope you will check out all these books and podcasts!</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">But remember, you should take a pause from consuming information so that you have time to digest and apply this knowledge to your life. </span>',

    Title: "Mistakes I Made as an Entrepreneur",
    Content:
      '<span style="font-weight: 400;">I made a lot of mistakes in my life, and many more in my entrepreneurial life. As most of you want and will open your own business, let me help you with what I’ve learned from my journey started years ago. </span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Having too many overheads</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Insurance, rent, staff, phone plans to pay. A lot of payments to be done for a start-up. So set up with what you have, particularly if you don’t have a lot of market visibility.. See if it is profitable, then you can invest more. Preferably other people’s money. </span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Not studying the market</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Now I know better. You should too, as this is a huge mistake. Make sure your product is wanted, that your audience needs your creation. How? Check the market gap by surveys, focus groups or even directly asking your potential customer. </span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Not focusing enough on my client</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I wanted my product to be perfect. As quality is essential, however, you should always have your customer in mind and communicating efficiently to them is how your business will survive. Own your niche, own your community by clearly understanding them. Get specific.</span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Depending on others to sell</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Your sales team should be great at selling what you do. But if they leave the company, it’s your responsibility to do it and prepare others to follow you. Be the number one salesperson of your company. How? Go out there, practice your pitch, see people\'s reactions and optimize.</span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Not knowing my client</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Trying to satisfy everyone means not satisfying perfectly the ones who matter. Think about your ideal client and go find them. It is ok to not work with everyone so that you save yourself time and energy. You think you are specific enough? Get deeper, I’m sure you can. </span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Giving up too soon</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Launching a business and working on it for a year was great, but when it did not end where I planned, I gave up. Now I am finally in a position to say that one year is not enough. Try changing your strategy, invest more and in other areas. Find a way to make it work, because there is always a way to do that. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, I needed to make those mistakes to learn what I did, to meet the people I met and build the network I have now. I hope this helped you to avoid some of my mistakes.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Let me know in the comments below what mistakes you made in your journey up until now and what it taught you. </span>',

    Title: "60 Days to Achieve Your Goals Before 2020",
    Content:
      '<span style="font-weight: 400;">Tips that will help you stick to your goals and actually achieve them by the end of 2020.</span>\r\n<ol>\r\n \t<li><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus</span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">On your goals and projects. With your list, remind yourself every single day about them. This is why is important to have reminders in the form of a vision board, moodboard or even just notes close to you. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">2. Set a routine and plan your days in advance</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Start in the morning with what gives you the energy to keep going through the day. It could be working out, meditation, drinking lemon juice etc. Don’t limit what all YouTubers are telling you to do. Get personal and see what works for you. Make it a ritual.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">In the evening, it’s time to work on your self-discovery. Yes, chasing money might sound great, but life, as you know, is about getting to know yourself. So write your breakthroughs, reflect, plan your next days, think of new ideas. Make this a ritual as well.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Finally, once a week, have an overview of your next 7 days. Like that, you can have an idea of what will happen next. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">3. Be consistent</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Imagine having as a goal at the beginning of the year to get fit. Do you think it would be enough to work out once or twice to achieve it? Of course not, it takes a lot more time. This applies to all your goals, personal or professional.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of people don’t succeed not because they are not smart, talented or have luck, but because they give up too soon. Be disciplined and commit to achieving your dreams. And don’t be afraid to change strategies.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope this helped! Let me know in the comments below how you do to continue your journey towards success. </span>',

    Title: "How to be a Girlboss *Moms Edition*",
    Content:
      '<span style="font-weight: 400;">As requested by my girl readers, I’m going to give you some tips on how to succeed in your business, career and personal life.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you know, I am everything you can imagine: an entrepreneur, a University lecturer, a wife, a mom, a sister, etc. And I get involved personally in everything. So girl, let me help you with some tips on how to manage all these roles successfully. </span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Have a vision</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">What is your ideal life? You may work 9 to 5, be exhausted and have no energy to spend with your children. If this is what you want, that is ok. If not, you should clearly understand that.</span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Ask yourself first what you want, then pass on to the other tips. </span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Prioritize</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">This applies to everything in life. If your job is your priority, you have to accept that something else will suffer, like eating less healthy, having less time to spend with your spouse, etc. With every choice, there is a sacrifice. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For me, my choice has always been time and freedom over money. Don’t get me wrong, I love making money, but I value my time more. </span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Delegate</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re a control freak like me, you may find this rather difficult. But you need to do it if you want a balanced life. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Try starting with food, cleaning your house, babysitting your child for a couple of hours, etc. See what works for you and start delegating. </span>\r\n\r\n<b><i>Relax a bit</i></b>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">We, as women, mothers and professionals, want to control everything, which is not possible. You do what you have to do, and then take a step back and let things develop as you planned. </span>\r\n\r\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope you find this useful. Let me know in the comments your own tips for succeeding as a busy mom or professional woman. </span>',

    Title: "Soft Skills You Need to Succeed",
    Content:
      '<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hello everyone! Let me address some of your questions regarding the soft skills we all need.</span>\n\n<b><i>What set of skills to develop more in order to succeed fast?</i></b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">A lot of great communicators have more chances compared to others to develop as successful professionals. This is because they are able to sell, attract investment, negotiate better. So communication skills are essential in my opinion. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If developed correctly and intensely, you can understand the human mind and actually predict customer behavior, which is one of a kind trait. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It’s much better to be part of your customer’s community. So the best way to understand them is to </span>\n\n<b><i>How to make customers trust your brand?</i></b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">The customer today can choose from so many options so you can convince them by offering them more than the others. This means your product has to be an incredible one, not seen in the market. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don’t have that, you may ask? Then your customer service quality comes into play. The quality is given by your perspective concerning your clients. Rather than seeing them as a money-making machine, see them as a long-lasting relationship. This is why thinking that in the first year you will sell a lot of products, you are living in a dream, as the trust takes time to build. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Think about and improve the following:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be there when and how they need or want</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is your unique selling proposition, how are you going to help them in a way others won’t?</span></li>\n</ul>\n<b><i>How to sell in an interview?</i></b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I have three tips on that:</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Prepare for every single interview</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">When you are pitching, you should always prepare. For every single one. Because they are all different as the person in front of you will be extremely different. Tailor your approach according to the problems and needs that the other part has. </span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Give it all your best</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t be too shy, don’t ever think you are giving too much. Even if the opportunity might not become a success, I assure you will at one point get the return on your investment. Be generous.</span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Be authentic</span></li>\n</ul>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Don’t try to copy someone else. You can have your own style and your own way of pitching. How? By practicing and therefore becoming more comfortable. </span>\n\n<b><i>How important is it to be honest with your potential client?</i></b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential. I would even go further to say that you should also be authentic, sincere with yourself. It has to come from the heart. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">How do I know? In many job interviews I attended, the conclusion often was ‘I don’t </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">feel</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that this person is right’. So many times feelings play a huge part in your interactions. This is why being authentic ensures a good connection with the other part of the discussion. </span>\n\n<b><i>How to boost your emotional intelligence?</i></b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">First, you should read on this subject, as this is essential to understand how you and the others around are functioning emotionally. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Secondly, meditation is considered by many people as an efficient way to improve this type of intelligence. You may think you are wasting 20 minutes of your life, but the reality is that you gain better mental health. Just quiet your mind and let it be, in this ever-busy life.</span>\n\n<b><i>What do you think about the law of attraction?</i></b>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I think only good things. I have to say I used to imagine many scenarios when I was young that actually come to life. Only in recent years did I realise that I really lived certain moments before in my brain. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So just try this exercise: think about something you really want in your life, imagine how it happens, feel it in your mind and body and then let go. This letting go is essential so that you don’t become frustrated. Don’t be obsessed, don’t try to control it. Let go and the universe will do it for you. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Hope my answers helped! Let me know in the comments below how you develop soft skills!</span>',

    Title: "12 Tips to Turn  the Crisis into an Opportunity",
    Content:
      '<span style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="https://youtu.be/bly6rcUw3lo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/YT-CRISIS-TO-OPPORTUNITY-THUMBNAIL-1024x576.png" alt="Turn Crisis into Opportunity" width="750" height="422" class="alignnone wp-image-1802 size-large" /></a></span>\n<h2><em>If your business is struggling and you need to help it survive the crisis, here are 12 tips to turn the crisis into an opportunity.</em></h2>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Since the beginning of the Coronavirus lockdown, small businesses were set to take a hit for an undefined time. Restaurants, cafes, malls were shut their doors to close down to prevent the spread of the virus. Non-essential stores were not spared and as a result, were not able to sell any more goods. Entrepreneurs, such as my friend whose handmade jewellery store is located in rue du Temple in Paris, saw their businesses with sales down by 100%. Only a few of them have e-commerce stores and can stay in touch with their clients. Luckily, service-based businesses, like mine, can be still run from home. Most of our deliverables can be done from the comfort of our beds but the problem is that clients are putting a hold on all projects as cashflow and revenues are scare. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So how do we, entrepreneurs, use the time we have in our hands to stay afloat and avoid a long crisis?</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Usually, I am the one giving advice and tips but this time, I knew I had to reach out to some friends and fellow entrepreneurs for some advice and guidance on how small business owners can turn this crisis into an opportunity. While at it, I thought other people could benefit from what they have to say and invited them to film themselves sharing their best tips.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">So, when your phone isn’t ringing anymore, your order book is empty, your clients are confined and stressed out, what do you do to help your business survive the crisis and better prepare for the post-lockdown?</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are tips from 8 experienced entrepreneurs on how to turn a sanitary and economic crisis into an opportunity:</span>\n\n<a href="https://youtu.be/bly6rcUw3lo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CLICK HERE TO WATCH THE VIDEO</strong></a>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>1. Reconnect with people:</strong> Sabirul Islam, entrepreneur and author, whom I have met in London back when he was 17 (more than 10 years ago) at an event where he was a guest speaker, says that he has met a lot of people in the past decade and he never got the chance to <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/2018/02/03/how-to-network-effectively-create-meaningful-connections/">reconnect</a> with each one of them. This is the best time, he says, to go back and re-engage with people who can be of value to your business and you can be of value to theirs. </span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>2. Connect to your audience:</strong> While Sabirul talks about real people who have met in your life, Elisabeth Kounou, Digital Marketing Coach, explains that you should make the most out of this time by connecting to your online audience: ask them questions, know what their needs are and how you can best help them. Social media is the way to go to be close to your audience and stay in touch with them.</span>\n\n<strong>3. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Post regularly on social media:</strong> As more people are staying home and have more free time to scroll Facebook, Instagram, Linkedin, TikTok, you have more chances to get noticed. Kounou says you should post as much as you can to show your customers you care for them and are helping them turning the crisis into an opportunity. Be creative and helpful in your posts!</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>4. Sell:</strong> Kounou says it’s important to sell during these times and <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/2019/04/14/how-to-effectively-sell-high-ticket-products-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sell shamelessly</a>. It is not wrong or unethical. When you sell, you not only help your business but also the economy. </span>\n\n<strong>5. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Know your essence:</strong> A lot of people want to create podcasts, YouTube videos, write books but it doesn’t make them come alive. Connie-Lee Bennett, public speaking coach, says the lockdown is a chance for entrepreneurs to do some introspective work. Ask yourself what brings you joy and what is the best expression of you. And certainly do not copy what others. Know what makes you feel alive and express it in your own unique way.</span>\n\n<strong>6. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Negotiate with your creditors:</strong> The idea is to survive during the crisis and make sure you continue to have cash flow, recommends Prince Tikare, Founder of SmooyPod. Talk to your creditors, negotiate new deadlines and make sure you don’t run out of cash. You may have to reduce some nonessential expenses and stick to the most vital ones. Turning a crisis into an opportunity stars with </span>\n\n<strong>7. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Re-organize and strategize your business:</strong> Since most businesses have time on their hands. This is the best opportunity to restructure, create an updated strategy and re-organize the workings of your business to better prepare for the post-lockdown, Tikare explains.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>8. Look out for new opportunities:</strong> Where there are problems, there are opportunities. Use this time to see how you can pivot your business or better serve your clients. Keep your eyes and ears open for new opportunities that you may not usually be attentive to.</span>\n\n<strong>9. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Educate your audience:</strong> Your regular social media content, as well as blog posts and podcasts, should help your audience learn and grow, says Yasmine Lesire, founder of <a href="https://ilearnfrench.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ILearnFrench</a>. Your content should be on how you can help your clients and how you can solve their problems. Do not focus the content around you (none cares unless you are a Kardashian ;) ) Make sure to educate your audience with tips in a way that helps them turn the crisis into a business opportunity.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>10. Stay connected to your audience and to why you started your business:</strong> As entrepreneurs, we are problem-solvers. This is the essence of what we do and who we are. During this crisis, Hanane Benkhalloukh, Founder of Sustain Leadership Consultancy, says you shouldn’t wait for this crisis to go away to back to ‘normal’ because normal is now being redefined. As an entrepreneur, you should stay connected to your audience because their needs may change, new problems may emerge that need solving. You may have to create a new business model accordingly. It’s also important to stay connected with why you started the business as this is what will keep you going during the Coronavirus crisis.</span>\n\n<strong>11. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Resist the urge to always find the answer:</strong> In times of great uncertainty and loss of control, we tend to want to fix and control outcomes and put out more content than needed. <a href="http://lilylapenna.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lily Lapenna</a>, CEO of Gleow, recommends not to jump to solutions and answers but rather live the question. Lapenna quotes Rainer Maria Rilke, in his book Letters to Young Poet: “And the point is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps you will then gradually, without noticing it, live along some distant day into the answer.”</span>\n\n<strong>12. </strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Let go completely:</strong> As part of letting go teachings, John Purkiss, executive search consultant and author of The <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/2018/03/27/how-to-let-go-achieve-success-faster-with-john-purkiss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Power of Letting Go,</a> says that during the COVID19 season, he’s been dropping all of his goals, action plans, thoughts, ideas, fantasies, dreams, etc. When he lets go, his intuition tells him what to do. This is certainly not the easiest tip to implement because it does require some work. Some practices such as meditation can help you be more connected to your intuition. The beautiful thing about letting go is that you can still be creative and productive (without all the stress). This is a tip I was applying to my personal life after having read The Power of Letting Go by Purkiss and A New Earth by Eckart Tolle. I will now start to implement it onto my business. Try it for yourself and start experiencing magic!</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">As you can see, to turn the crisis into an opportunity is not just business tactics and strategies to implement. This crisis is giving us the gift of time,  a chance to do some inner work, connect with ourselves and our essence and also re-question what we are doing. A lot of us will take different directions, change business activities or even close down their ventures. It is not all bad. Whatever you decide or comes your way, may you stay safe, healthy and peaceful.</span>\n\n<strong>To watch the video, click <a href="https://youtu.be/bly6rcUw3lo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</strong>\n\n<strong>QUESTION: What tips will you start implementing in your business during the COVID19 outbreak?</strong>',

    Title: "What I Learned During the Coronavirus Lockdown",
    Content:
      '<p><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Canva-White-Toilet-Paper-Roll-And-Face-Mask-on-Wooden-Surface-1024x683.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="500" class="wp-image-1809 size-large alignright"></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Before Macron announced that France was going to be on lockdown for at least 15 days, I was secretly hoping it wasn’t going to happen. I don’t recall myself thinking that but this is what I wrote back then in my journal. It feels so far out when in fact, it’s only been a little over two months. In these 2 months, I learned so much about myself, the people around me, my clients and students.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Being home with my husband and two children required me to call on a new set of skills. How is it possible to work remotely while homeschooling 2 kids and cooking/cleaning all day? Well, somehow, it was crazy but possible. Early on, I decided that as a family we needed to have a routine. After all, we were not on vacation. Things I never thought possible before were now my reality. This suggests how our mind tricks us into limiting us when in fact, our capabilities and potential are enormous.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This high adaptability was also shown amongst most of my students. They quickly got the hang of our online classes and to my surprise, they were even more engaged than ever before. For me, that was a blessing as they actively participated in our online sessions minus all the chit-chatting that usually happens in class.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">During the lockdown, I also surprised myself by the fact that I didn’t need or felt the need to go out. I usually love going for long walks, to the park or to coffee shops. Aside from going to the supermarket or taking the kids out, I barely stepped out of the house. Somehow my mind was in peace with the situation. I didn’t try to control it. I didn’t wish for other events. I just was. I don’t take credit for this. I am pretty sure my reading of A New Earth by Eckart Tolle and The Power of Letting Go by John Purkiss helped me tremendously deal with this situation. Putting aside my ego, truly feeling that we are part of one universe and surrendering are teachings that undoubtedly helped me go through the quarantine.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While the virus was spreading around the world and taking down lives, it was tempting to watch and follow the news. Friends and family would send me statistics of the situation, testimonials of people who’ve contracted the virus, videos on its rapid spread etc. I quickly felt overwhelmed and saddened. There was no way I was going to keep up-to-date with the news on the daily. Knowing that more people are dying affected my mood and spirit. After all, all I could do was to stay home and not to help it circulate.&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lockdown was also an opportunity to witness the goodness in people and the solidarity that we all have in our hearts. Despite the high risks of contracting the virus, there was always someone ready to help. Elders were delivered groceries on their doorstep. Food was donated in supermarkets for the needy. I also appreciated the determination of people on the front line such as shop tenants, pharmacists, nurses, doctors...who were the heroes of this pandemic. At times I felt grateful that I didn’t have to go out and expose myself to the virus while these people had to leave their families with the fear of succumbing to it.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The quarantine made me connect in new ways with my neighbors. While keeping space with one another, we still met after work. It was almost our daily thing to do before dinner. It allowed us grown-ups to maintain a social life and for the kids to play and get some fresh air. Humans are social animals and we truly need one another especially in difficult times. I realized that being part of a community is actually good for health and mind.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While keeping in touch with my clients, preparing and delivering online classes, taking care of my family, I managed to create time to simply be. Sitting outside observing the birds chirping or the wind blowing the tree leaves, little insects rushing to save their lives… I realized that there is an entire universe within my world that I barely take the time to appreciate. I started noticing the sky, the new flowers emerging and the little snails outside my house. Taking the time to notice all this is a blessing. We are truly not alone. Our daily choices do impact our environment that we barely notice.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Somehow I also managed to continue my daily quick Italian lessons, read poetry, listen to books and podcasts, bake, garden and pick up my childhood passions: drawing and painting. It may be because I also decided to significantly reduce my social media consumption during this lockdown. I was still taking pictures for myself but didn’t have the urge to share my daily life on Instagram. It was mine and it felt good to be private again.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the peak of the crisis, I paid off all my outstanding invoices and debts. A contractor of mine laughed saying people are avoiding paying now and that I am rushing onto paying his newly submitted invoice. I truly didn’t know how the situation was going to turn out. While death is something that can happen anytime and any day, I almost felt I was in a riskier situation and needed to do what needed to be done had I known that my death was near. I called my family more often and checked on old friends as well. With that said, I am still waiting for some clients to pay my invoices. I have faith they will eventually do.</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The future is unsure. Everything is unclear. There are questions that I ask myself about my business and career that I do not have the answer to. I don’t know what the next months are going to look like. I attempt to make plans but they remain plans. I am living by Rainer’s famous quote:&nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Be patient toward all that is unsolved in your heart and to try to love the questions themselves like locked rooms and like books that are written in a very foreign tongue.”</span></p>\n<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Corona Crisis is an opportunity for us all to test our limits. See how much we can take and how far we can go. It’s a personal development challenge. We always complained of lack of time. Now we have time to focus on the essential. The essential is right here and right now. Getting in touch with oneself and learning to just be.</span></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3q9mkyk"><strong>Click here to join our vibrant and buzzing community.</strong></a></p>\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->',

You could create a FB group or start a YouTube. Bring like-minded people together. This may be a long-term project but it’s worth it as you may eventually be able to monetize it. Start off by looking for existing communities that have been impacted by the crisis because they relied too much on in-person activities. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Home-made meals:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> People need to eat but they are tired of cooking. And takeaways are not always healthy. Home-made meals delivered to your door could be an exciting solution for many households.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Kids entertainment: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kids are at home. They need to be entertained. Think of ways you can get them busy while their parents are working remotely. Can you offer a book reading service to occupy a child for x number of hours? Maybe you’ll help with his homework, then play chess and finally give him a painting tutorial?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Social life for students: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Students are craving social life. They can’t go out to pubs and nightclubs. Could you re-create a night-club ambience online?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Networking: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Everyone understands now the power of networking. Not only are we social animals, but we came to realize that we need people to grow our businesses and careers. How can you facilitate people meeting and exploring opportunities together?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Artists’ management consultancy</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Artists are home, not giving any live performance. Now they need an online presence. Maybe you could help them build their online brand and set up an e-store. Look no further. Your target is right there: cancelled concerts and other performances. </span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Consultancy Business: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Helping brick and mortar businesses convert to online services</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Education:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Education from kindergarten to university is changing. What tools, software and strategies can you put in place for teachers to deliver their courses and students to learn better?</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Online payment: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Not all businesses have an online payment method established. For my children’s school, we had to mail out a check for the payment. Businesses like these need an electronic solution to take payments.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Sustainable fashion + tailored:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> People are buying less glamour and purchasing more long-lasting items. I sense that fast fashion will die soon. I mean I hope so. People are looking for sustainable material and also customized outfits. If you love fashion, this may be for you.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Repairs services: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">As people have less disposable income and more people become environment-conscious, it’s a good idea to give a second life to broken house appliances. Maybe you could offer a repair service for items such as phone, TV, toys, sewing machine… You could dispatch your team of handymen where needed. The idea is to convince the consumer to save money and not pollute the planet.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Stock market:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> When people stop buying stocks, that\'s when you should buy them. Invest in stocks, get educated and this could be the only business you need right now.</span></li>\n</ol>\nHope you find these business ideas helpful.

      "How letting go of my goals and a business schedule helped me be productive & happier ",
    Content:
      '<em>This is how I ditched a busy and hectic lifestyle, let go of my goals and became more productive and happier.</em>\n\n<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDd8Nf_iIQU&amp;t=539s"><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Not-getting-anywhere-300x169.png" alt="productive and happier" width="513" height="289" class="alignright wp-image-1851"></a>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For many years I have been focused on setting goals and doing everything that was possible to actually achieve them. Whether they were business or personal goals, I always made sure I had myself occupied pursuing projects and plans because after all, I thought I was an ambitious gal and that’s what ambitious people do.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">At the end of 2019 and like every year I created my 2020 goals list only this time I noticed a huge shift in the objectives I set myself. I followed the instructions of a friend who suggested I choose the feelings I wanted to have throughout the year rather than focus on the actual goals. The exercise calls for thinking first of how you want to feel and from that, you draw the goals that will bring you those feelings. For example: I urge you to do the exercise for yourself and I will link up the video we demonstrate the exercise. So I did that and to my surprise, the feelings I was after were more to do with having fun and feeling good, something I have disconnected with since I was so focused on work and no fun for many years.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">For the two first months of the year, nothing really changed much. I was still having a hectic lifestyle with a million things on my to-do list. When the Coronavirus health crisis hit and the lockdown started, I was still having a busy schedule with my business, online classes, teaching and grading papers etc. When the semester was over, I decided not to have any commitments or any obligations outside of the obvious: my family and must-dos for my business (nothing more).</span>\n\n[embed]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDd8Nf_iIQU&amp;t=539s[/embed]\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">While giving myself the chance to just take it slow and really focus on just feeling good - something that was foreign to me because I am a big believer in being active, productive and not wasting time, I realized I:</span>\n<ol>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally developed a daily morning <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/2019/10/11/3-simple-habits-for-energy-productivity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">routine</a>: every day I’d do my reading (I chose a spiritual scripture, to begin with which I am still reading to date), do a payer and meditation and work on my Italian language skills. It’s been almost 4 months now and I have not broken the streak. This daily routine gives me the ability to stay focused and balanced throughout the day.&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I became more consistent with my workout: I can work out daily and not feel bored. I always dreaded working out now I am finding it very enjoyable and challenging. My body is also craving moving when I don’t do much exercice.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">I literally forgot what social media is: Don’t get me wrong I love social media and talking to you guys but naturally, I stopped checking my phone and didn’t have any urge to check other people’s profiles or feeds. I was finally focused on myself and my needs. This is also great because I found myself comparing less myself to others and have those frustrations we all do.</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Focus on living the moment. It’s one thing to spend time with someone and it’s another spending quality time. I realized I became more present and I owe that to John Purkiss and Eckart Tolle thanks to their books The Power of Letting Go and The Power of Now. I can spend time with my kids, cook, clean, paint with more intention and less stress. I barely do anything in a rush like I used to do or multi-task. Living the moment without being stressed about what is coming or what has happened is such a gift and I am appreciating it more and more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li>\n \t<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have better ideas and clarity: During the past few months, I also made the decisions to stop pursuing certain actions and even more difficult ones like closing down a couple of my businesses and pivoting existing ones. I also decided to start a business in France and this is going to be a first for me. I will have to find out how a lot of things work here. If you’re interested in following my journey of business creation in France, let me know. I am thinking I could perhaps vlog the process although I am really bad at vlogging.</span></li>\n</ol>\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall, doing less has brought so many benefits to my life lately. Focusing on the priorities and what truly makes me feel good and happy is priceless. Life is not about doing and achieving a lot. Life is about achieving what is meaningful to you. With a lighter schedule and more flexibility, you can think with clarity, be more creative, spend time doing what matters most and above all feel and be happy.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a long journey to reach this point.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Here are books that I have read that have helped me. I will share them with you in the description box below/ notes.&nbsp;</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">I hope this will inspire you to review your schedule and prepare the last 4 months of the year with a new approach that will be in line with who you are and your core values.</span>\n\n<span style="font-weight: 400;">Leave me a comment and hope to hear from you soon.</span>',

La liberté d’expression qu’on prône a ses limites. On nous fait croire que nous sommes libres mais en réalité, nous ne le sommes pas. Nous sommes libres de nous exprimer comme nous le voulons mais seulement dans un cadre bien précis. Comme pour un oiseau à qui on fait croire qu’il peut voler sauf qu’il est dans une cage.</p>\n<p>Nous sommes témoins de nombreux cas de personnes s’exprimant sous couvert de la liberté d’expression sur le sol de pays promouvant cette valeur et se faisant arrêter par les autorités sous prétexte que les propos tenus vont à l’encontre d’évènements historiques.</p>\n<p>Quelles sont donc les limites de cette liberté ? Rappelons un vieux proverbe : La liberté des uns s\'arrête là où commence celle des autres. Le respect des uns et des autres est la clef du succès d’une société.</p>\n<p>En tant qu’entrepreneure et enseignante universitaire, je ne me permets pas de m’exprimer librement avec mes collaborateurs et étudiants.

En effet, c’est un concept important à encourager au sein des jeunes générations. Cela ne se fait pas n’importe comment. Une invitation à la liberté de pensée ne peut réussir que si cela fait dans les règles de l’art : le respect d’autrui. Je ne peux pas vouloir montrer le ridicule du végétalisme (si tant est que je partage cette opinion) en provocant les végétaliens en me moquant de leurs croyances et fermes convictions. Il y a toujours un détraqué quelque part prêt à déclencher la guerre et à mourir pour sa cause… C\'est encore plus vrai quand le nombre de végétaliens atteint les milliards d\'individus sur la planète.</p>\n<p>Notre rôle en tant que parents et enseignantes est d’élever des jeunes respectueux des croyances des uns et des autres et qui sont capables de critiquer sans heurter les âmes sensibles de leurs concitoyens.</p>\n<p>La liberté d’expression a un prix.

    Title: "Freedom of Speech: The Illusion",
    Content:
      "Are we truly free to express ourselves as we wish?\n\nCan we express our singularity and dress as we feel on the street?\n\nCan we express our hatred toward that annoying colleague at work in the name of freedom of expression?\n\nCan we mock and make fun of our neighbors’ beliefs and values because freedom of expression gives us that right?\n\nYes, to freedom of expression but hold on. Freedom of expression has its limits. We are taught to believe that we are free when in fact we are not. We are not free to express ourselves as we wish. We only do so within boundaries. Just like a bird who believes it can fly when it’s actually in a cage.\n\nWe need to keep in mind the thinkers and comedians who, in the very countries that promote freedom of expression, have been arrested and thrown in jails because of their ideas as they expressed them?\n\nWhat are the limits of this freedom then? There is a saying that goes: Freedom ends where that of others begins. Honoring the diversity of opinions and thoughts is the key element of a society’s success.\n\nAs a business owner and university instructor, I cannot freely express myself with my colleagues and students. I censor myself for the good of all. As a mother, I do not let my kids say whatever and anything about their teachers and classmates particularly when this touches the respect, honor, and dignity of the other.\n\nHelping the youth develop their critical thinking is another story. It is indeed important to encourage the younger generations to be curious and think critically. But this cannot be done randomly. An invitation to freedom of expression can only be done with respect for others. I cannot show the ridicule of veganism (not that it’s ridicule) while provoking the entire community of vegans and making fun of their beliefs and convictions. There is always a psychopath somewhere ready to start a war and die thinking s/he was right. This is even more true when the number of vegans reaches billions on the planet.\n\nOur role as parents and teachers is to raise young people respecting other people’s beliefs and able to be critical without hurting the sensible feelings of their fellow citizens.\n\nFreedom of expression has a price. How much are we willing to pay?\n\n#unitenotdivide #freedomofspeech #libertedexpression",

    Title: "WHY ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS HARD",
    Content:
      '<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;"><img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Entrepreneurship-is-hard.png" alt="entrepreneurship is hard " width="560" height="315" class="size-full wp-image-1973 alignright" />Entrepreneurship, the art of creating and building profitable businesses, has become this cool and sexy thing in the past years thanks to social media. On Facebook and Instagram, young people share messages about how fantastic their jobs are and quotes stating that anyone can reach their level of success. How-to and inspirational videos as well as the self-help book industry, made the dream that once only a handful could have now accessible to the masses no matter their social statuses or educational backgrounds.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">But is entrepreneurship for everyone?</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">The short answer is no.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">The long answer takes a little bit more explanation.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">Entrepreneurship is attractive because people believe that by becoming entrepreneurs, they can have free time, more money, more security, and none to boss them around. While it can be true to some extent, there is no guarantee that by becoming an entrepreneur, one could check all these boxes. Having more free time will only depend on how the entrepreneur manages his/her time and on the type of business that s/he runs. For at least the first three years, the entrepreneur will spend more time working than spending time with his/her family and drinking cocktails by the pool. When you are an entrepreneur, you work day in day out. You do not log the hours. No rest during weekends and holidays. Your mind is always working. That is why it is crucial to create a <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/2018/01/12/what-building-a-real-business-means/" style="color: #000000;">business</a> and not a job for you, which will make you self-employed and not a business owner. That is a big difference.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">Entrepreneurship is attractive because people believe that by becoming entrepreneurs, they can have free time, more money, more security, and none to boss them around. </span></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">Choosing entrepreneurship for making money is not such a great idea, especially if you are looking to make a quick buck. Building a reputation, credibility, and clientele takes time. While you could have a few orders at the beginning, nothing guarantees that you will have enough cash flow to continue paying your monthly expenses and leave some money aside for you. Unless the business you run requires no overheads, the money you make is not your money. You first need to pay off all your charges, taxes and then whatever is left is finally yours. Making more money would mean that the business you’re in is highly lucrative and that you have a line-up of clients willing to pay you for your products and services. If you don’t have these two things checked, you will go down the long road which, with hard work and patience, will eventually pay off.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">As for security, after COVID19, I think everyone realized that none is safe or secure. It is all illusions. When you’re an employee, you could be fired and dismissed any time. This is not foreign to entrepreneurs either, especially those who rely on one or two big clients to run their businesses. Nothing is sure, guaranteed, and set in stone. Clients come and go—Trends change. New products and service emerge all the time. Going for entrepreneurship to look for security is not rational.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">As for security, after COVID19, I think everyone realized that none is safe or secure.</span></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">And finally, the desire to be one’s boss is another idea that appeals to a lot of people. While it may be true that you’ll not have someone you will call ‘boss’, you will still have bosses. Your clients are disguised bosses. You need them, you depend on them, and their agenda becomes your agenda. Their priorities become yours. Their needs become the tasks you need to complete. Their emergencies become your concerns.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">Entrepreneurship is hard work. It is a long journey of giving, serving, making mistakes and learning. A real entrepreneur must continuously keep up with the challenges and changes they go through. Recently I learned that <a href="https://www.gibert.com/" style="color: #000000;">Gibert Joseph</a>, the iconic French bookstore in the Quartier Latin in Paris, is doomed to close. After 95 years in business, the company could not keep up with the book industry shifts. They cannot compete with Amazon and other large online marketplaces. Adapting to the ever-changing market is a necessity to keep up in business and to thrive in the long run.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">Being an entrepreneur is also about continually being <a href="https://safaanhairy.com/2020/05/02/12-ways-small-businesses-can-turn-the-crisis-into-an-opportunity/" style="color: #000000;">resourceful</a>. Finding solutions, better ways of working and financing are things entrepreneurs do on the daily. It can be exhausting (or exciting) to always have to come up with ideas that impact non only the business but the lives of your business’ stakeholders well as your family’s.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">Being an entrepreneur is very lonely. There is a phrase I often hear which is ‘it’s lonely at the top’. If you are the sole owner of your business, chances are you will spend a lot of time alone, thinking, working, and taking action solo. There are things that your team will not feel concerned with, and when the storm hits, you will have to handle it all by yourself.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">It’s lonely at the top’</span></strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">Entrepreneurship is hard work. It is a daily hustle to build and grow. Money, freedom, and fame do not come overnight. They are the fruit of determination, consistency, work, and patience. Not everyone is able to go through the challenges of entrepreneurship. Not everyone will. Entrepreneurship is for the fierce and fearless. Real entrepreneurs are not afraid to lose everything because they can re-build it. Their biggest asset is not their net worth or reputation. Their biggest asset is their skills and qualities that make them turn a simple idea into an entity that brings value to people’s lives. Real entrepreneurs are driven by something far greater than financial gain. They are human beings working to make our lives better.</span></p>\n<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true" style="color: #000000;">Only the truly driven entrepreneurs will succeed. May you be one of them!</span></p>\n\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\n<p><strong>QUESTION: Why do you want to become an entrepreneur?

      "The Great Resignation Doesn’t Concern Just the Millennials. And what do they really want?",
    Content:
      'In June 2021, 3.9 Americans quit their jobs. In July, another 3.9 million workers and in August, 4.3 million. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, around 14 million Americans were neither working nor looking for jobs. This is to say that around 10.4 million jobs in the US remain unfilled. This widespread trend of a significant number of workers leaving their jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic is called The Great Resignation or sometimes The Big Quit.\n\n<img src="https://safaanhairy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/I-QUIT.png" alt="" width="560" height="315" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1981">\n\nCandice-Lee Cohen, 35, an American citizen who grew up in South Africa, told me that she quit her yacht job, working for billionaires, to live in Paris, France. For many years, she’s been trying to find a way to work in Europe. Before her yacht employment, she has been a successful property manager for 15 years in Johannesburg. In 2016, she was sitting at her desk in the central district, looking out the window and asked herself: ‘is this it?’ At the time, she was obsessed with Peru, spirituality, and the Amazon rainforest. ‘You’re not going to get there by being here,’ Cohen told herself and that was the decisive moment where she decided to quit her job and lifestyle of a top broker in the country.\n<blockquote>‘You’re not going to get there by being here’</blockquote>\nCohen, like many young people in her generation, is striving for something more than just a job title and a paycheck. In her book entitled ‘The Book on Authentic Leadership’, Connie-Lee Bennett explains that as time goes on, more and more people feel they are not fulfilling their potential. She explains that people want to fulfill their life mission and make an impact but don’t know how. ‘This is what your journey here on Earth is all about: uncovering who you truly are, fully expressing this and as you grow to connect more with who you authentically are, contribute this to others,’ Bennett writes. In search of meaning and purpose, generation Z seems to be smashing the old dream being sold to them. Going to university, getting a job and getting into debt to buy a house is not the goal anymore. Like Cohen, many recall that ‘something was missing in their lives’.\n<blockquote><em>Going to university, getting a job and getting into debt to buy a house is not the goal anymore.</em></blockquote>\nVanessa Yee-Joy, an Australian who grew up in Fiji, is not new at quitting jobs and going for the unknown. At 34, she has done it already a few times. Asked if it takes courage to quit a stable job and income, she replies: ‘What’s the worst that can happen? Go back to Australia?’. Her dream has always been to live in Europe for the lifestyle and Paris is her current home after living in the Netherlands. ‘I think it’s a Millennials thing,’ Yee-Joy told me, ‘We have more opportunities than our parents and we question ourselves.’ Is this how you want to live your life? Seems to be a question a lot of Millennials ask themselves as they have more academic degrees and opportunities than the previous generation. Generation Y seems to be more okay with handling uncertainty and financial insecurity. The thrive for more meaning and fulfillment appear to be their top priority.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post, Arianna Huffington, the American philanthropist, wrote: ‘What’s being affirmed is the growing desire to rethink what gives us meaning in our lives and what makes us truly thrive. It’s less of a Great Resignation and more of a Great Reevaluation. And it’s giving us a once-in-a-generation opportunity to redefine how we work and live.’\n\nClaudia Amendola Alzraa, 33 years old, Canadian currently living in Paris, says: ‘One day, I woke up and simply knew that if I didn\'t do it now, I would never do it. So, I sent in my unpaid leave of absence, and then a year later sent in my finalized resignation.’ Alzraa quit her 100k annual salary in Canada and came to France to start a life from scratch. She now works for herself as a content manager, professional editor, and freelance writer, along with her spiritual mediumship reading. While she’s based in Paris, Alzraa’s clients are mainly in the UK and US. With setting one’s own sole entrepreneurship business comes money challenges to which Alzraa’s doesn’t seem too concerned with: ‘I am way happier now with my "uncertain income" and renting my apartment than I was living my comfortable salaried life and owning my own home in Canada,’ she tells me, ‘I have a pretty simple lifestyle - I love books, I love collecting nerdy things, and I love to travel. I am not someone who wears brand-name clothing or eats at five-star restaurants. It\'s a pretty easy lifestyle to maintain.’\n<blockquote>I am not someone who wears brand-name clothing or eats at five-star restaurants. It\'s a pretty easy lifestyle to maintain.’</blockquote>\nThe Pandemic was an opportunity for many to realize that what mattered in their lives was not the Gucci bag and the Ferrari car. Paula A, 36, a Portuguese living in Paris, quit a job at her own company. The Pandemic made her realize that she needed to wind down her distressful tech business. Like many, Paula didn’t have any clear plan after closing down the company. After months of reflection and rest, she now has an opportunity in the Netherlands and is thinking to move there with her French husband who can work remotely full-time. Her motto is: ‘Do something that makes you happy.’ Being one’s own boss is not necessarily the ultimate happiness guarantee for these Millennials. The goal may not be to be financially independent or an entrepreneur. The goal is to be happy, for many.\n\nBut is The Great Resignation a Millennial-only thing?\n\nI have recently met an American couple coming from a town of 2000 people near El Paso in the USA who quit their surgeon and university lecturer jobs to come to live in the Paris suburbs with their two children. They moved in 3 months ago for the new school year and are still looking for jobs and opportunities for themselves while their children are schooled at an international school. At that point, I had thought that the Great Resignation was only for the 20 and 30 something single people. The couple I have met must have been in their 50s and their main motive is to be able to live in an international environment such as Paris where access to culture, gastronomy and Europe is not a luxury. ‘And it’s easier for our friends to fly from NY to Paris than to fly from NY-El Paso then drive for 3 hours to come to our town.’\n\nWhether that’s international travel, freedom from a 9-5 job, desire to be one’s boss or the mere ability to live new experiences and lifestyles, these young careerists’ primary concern is to live a fulfilling life, a life many personal developments gurus promote as being possible and attainable. Today, young people dare to dream and often disappoint family and friends by quitting financial security and by going overseas. They are aware that they have only one life and they surely want to make the most out of it. The dream has shifted from material possessions to inner happiness and bliss. The corporate stress and burnout for well-paid salaries are not for those who are looking inward, listening to their inner desires and being in, what yogis call, alignment. In alignment with who they truly are or like Bennett says: ‘Your value is your authenticity’. Being one of the most privileged youth in the world, these Millennials have one valuable thing their parents never had or dreamed of: choice. The choice to be whomever, work from wherever and do whatever they want. The rat race could be just a perceived thing. The strenuous and wearisome can be ended if the worker takes the time to stop and reflect, which was a unique opportunity for millions during the Pandemic.\n\nWhile the health crisis helped many realize that there is more to life than just a paycheck, many, in heavy debt or frightened to make the leap, are flirting with ego -- kill it,’ Alzraa says.\n\nThis article has been written by Safaa Nhairy: www.safaanhairy.com',
